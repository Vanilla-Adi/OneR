          <p class="weekend-content__weekend-text">
            Each Sunday morning for over a decade, One River’s CIO, Eric Peters, has published “Wknd Notes.” 
            It is an unorthodox take on markets, politics, and policy that’s widely read across our industry 
            and within global policy/political circles. Eric has written for as long as he has traded and the 
            discipline is part of his investment process. Drawing on wide-ranging, multi-disciplinary research, 
            historical study, and discussions with interesting characters throughout the world, Eric collects 
            those things he finds most thought-provoking each week and distills them into a concise letter. At 
            times the ideas and views are consistent with his own, but just as often, they challenge his positions 
            and it is this openness to opposing views that helps him maintain a flexible mind in the search for 
            emerging opportunities and risks. His writing is a reflection of how he thinks, and as such it is as 
            focused on identifying the right questions to ask as it is on seeking answers. The publication of this 
            work is Eric’s way of exchanging ideas/information and developing dialogue with a network grown over 
            his thirty-one-year career.

              Dusted off an anecdote from late 2018, exploring the preconditions for what has started to unfold in 
              markets, politics, policy (see below). It’s often good to step back, survey the landscape. The dynamics 
              that brought us here were decades in the making. And it would be unprecedented if this cycle shift

            <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
              Anecdote (Oct 2018): The future is unknowable. Yet never has capital been so concentrated in strategies that 
              depend on the future closely resembling the past. The most dominant of these strategies requires bonds to rally 
              when stocks fall. For decades, both rose inexorably. And a new array of increasingly complex and illiquid strategies 
              depends on a jump in volatility to be followed by a rapid decline of equal magnitude. They appear uncorrelated until 
              they are not. Virtually every investment portfolio measures risk by utilizing some combination of volatility and 
              correlation, both of which are backward-looking and low. But the present is knowable. The past too. And the multi-decade 
              trends that carried us to today produced levels of inequality rarely seen. Low levels of inflation, growth, productivity, 
              and volatility are features of this cycle’s increasingly unequal distribution. But cycle extremes produce pressures that 
              reverse their direction. On cue, an anti-establishment political wave washed away the globalists, with promises to turn 
              the tide. Such change is nothing new, just another loop around the sun. Now signs of a cycle swing abound; shifting trade 
              agreements, global supply chains, military dynamics, immigration, wage pressures, polarization, nationalism, tribalism. 
              To an observer, it’s neither right nor wrong, it simply is. Some see parallels between today and the late-1930s, which 
              led to World War II. We also see parallels with the mid-1960s, which led to The Great Inflation. What comes next is sure 
              to look different still. But investment strategies that prospered from the past decade’s low inflation, growth, productivity 
              and volatility will face headwinds as this cycle turns. Those strategies that suffered should enjoy tailwinds. That’s 
              how cycles work. And we know the 1940s was a strong decade for Trend performance. The 1970s was the best decade for Trend 
              in 150yrs. And following cycle turns in both the 1930s and 1960s, the world became a profoundly volatile place.
