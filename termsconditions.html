            </h3>
            This website is the property of One River Asset Management, LLC (“One River”). One River is registered with the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment adviser. One River is also registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a CPO and as a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Neither registration with the SEC and CFTC, nor membership with the NFA implies a certain level of skill or training. All investing involves risk of loss, including the possible loss of all amounts invested.
            <br>
            <br>
            Access to this site is conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. By accessing this website, you signify your agreement with, and understanding of, the terms of use and legal information pertaining to both this site and any materials contained herein. One River reserves the right to change the terms, conditions, and notices under which this site is provided at any time and without notice.
            <br>
            <br>
            You agree that the information on this site may not be transmitted (in any form) to any other person (other than your legal, accounting and financial advisors) without One River’s prior written consent. You agree to keep all such information confidential and to use such information solely for evaluating and/or monitoring an investment in an investment vehicle managed by One River. Certain portions of this website may be accessed only by (i) current One River investors, (ii) prospective investors who are qualified as to both suitability and net worth and with whom One River has a substantive preexisting relationship or (iii) the legal, accounting and financial advisors of persons described in (i) and (ii). Any investment strategies referred to herein may transact business in your state or jurisdiction only if first excluded or exempted from applicable registration requirements.
            <br>
            <br>
            All materials on this site are meant to be reviewed in their entirety, including any footnotes, legal disclaimers, restrictions or disclosures, and any copyright or proprietary notices. Any disclaimers, restrictions or disclosures apply to any partial document or material in the same manner as they do the whole, and will be deemed incorporated in the portion of any material that you consult or download.

            <br>
            <p class="privacy-section__h">QUALIFIED ELIGIBLE PERSONS</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Information on this website is intended for use only by persons and entities that are “Qualified Eligible Persons” as defined in CFTC Regulation 4.7. Past results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Futures and options trading is extremely speculative and highly risky and is not suitable for all investors. There can be no assurance that an account or fund will earn any profits at all or will be able to avoid incurring substantial losses, including the entire loss of the investment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pursuant to an exemption from the CFTC in connection with accounts of qualified eligible persons, this document is not required to be, and has not been, filed with the commission. The CFTC does not pass upon the merits of participating in a trading program or upon the adequacy or accuracy of commodity trading advisor disclosure. Consequently, the CFTC has not reviewed or approved any of the trading programs or any of the information on this website. Nothing contained in this website constitutes investment, legal or tax advice.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="privacy-section__h">NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE OR A PUBLIC SOLICITATION</p>
            <br>
            <p>         
                This website and the information contained herein are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a complete description of our investment management services or investment vehicles. It is not intended as investment advice. The information contained herein constitutes neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities. Such an offer will be made only to qualified investors by means of a private offering memorandum and related subscription documents and only in those jurisdictions where permitted by law.

            <p class="privacy-section__h">INVESTMENT RISKS AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hedge funds and other alternative investments are illiquid, subject to a substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for many investors. An investment in a One River investment strategy is subject to a variety of risks, certain of which are disclosed in the relevant investment vehicle’s private offering memorandum.
                <br>
                <br>
                Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and is no guarantee of future returns. Return objectives are only targets and may not be achieved. Performance figures are unaudited estimates and are based on information from third-party sources that may be inaccurate or incomplete. Any comparison to an index is for illustrative purposes only. The investment strategies and risk characteristics of One River investment strategies are typically different from those of an index. Individual returns may vary due to, among other things, the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals, side pocket investments, tax withholding, special allocations of new issues and/or different fee arrangements.
                <br>
                <br>
                One River believes that the information it provides is reliable. Nevertheless, neither One River nor its agents are liable for any deficiencies in the accuracy, completeness, availability or timeliness of such information. The information provided on this website does not necessarily reflect the most up to date or current information available on the investment vehicle in question. The information contained herein is provided without any warranty of any kind.
