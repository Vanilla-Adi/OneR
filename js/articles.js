      “Miami's yachts are way bigger than a few years ago,” bellowed Biggie Too in baritone. “And it’s getting crowded on the water,” he said. “All my boys say this isn’t 2008, we still got time.” Like in 2007. “But things are feeling weird to Biggie,” said Too, sliding comfortably into 3rd person, like a warm bubble bath. “We been here, seen this, like right before the pandemic, like when we all were saying this is just another SARS, MERS – like a few hundred get sick in some crowded Hong Kong block, the media gets hysterical, then it’s over,” barked Biggie Too, global chief strategist for one of Wall Street’s too-big-to-fail affairs. “But now it’s Putin on the border, and Biggie’s starting to feel like we’re all complacent. Like we think it’ll play out just fine, like it has for decades,” whispered Too. “And this rotation in equities feels like a real bear market.” And the Fed hasn’t even hiked or sold a single bond yet. “Biggie smells the kind of market that grinds, churns, until one day the bottom just falls out.”

      <b>Overall:</b> “We are facing a blatant attempt to rewrite the rules of our international system,” said Von der Leyen. “China and Russia seek a ‘New Era’ as they say, to replace the existing international order,” continued the EU Commission Chief. “They prefer the rule of the strongest to the rule of law, intimidation instead of self-determination, coercion instead of cooperation.” The existing international order is a historical anomaly. It took a second world war to thrust humanity sufficiently deep into the darkness that we came to see the light – the first world war was insufficient. The 1944 Bretton Woods agreement between 44 allied nations marked a departure from all previous post-war accords. The US could have demanded anything it wanted in exchange for supporting our allies and winning the war. But instead, it agreed to secure global trade routes, and open America’s vast consumer market to imports from allies (even from adversaries). In exchange the US asked for allegiance, but little more. It was an utterly extraordinary display of using strength in the service of good, and in so doing, lifting us all, inspiring our better angels. The rise in human prosperity that followed Bretton Woods is unparalleled in human history. We came to accept the resulting stability as a permanent state. This encouraged entrepreneurs to optimize the economy for low latency, just-in-time delivery. It allowed our financiers to leverage balance sheets to generate the highest possible returns. The process, in all its complexity, was disinflationary. The pendulum swung from a pre-war position of low profitability and high redundancy to a recent extreme of extraordinary profitability and high fragility. Irrespective of how events unfold in Ukraine and Taiwan in the months and years ahead, that pendulum has begun its long arc back.

      <b>Pendulum:</b> “If Russia invades, that means tanks and troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2,” threatened Biden a couple weeks ago. “We will bring an end to it.” The pipeline is complete but not yet operating. Gas prices are well off the highs, but still painfully firm. Shutting Nord Stream 2 would be economically painful for both Russia and Europe. “We are jointly ready, all of NATO is ready,” Biden said, unsure of the political price to win an economic war with Russia, while his ratings sink, as inflation rises. 
    </p>
    <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Pendulum II:</b> Over 90% of the world’s most sophisticated microprocessors are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). While all sorts of design work happens in the US and Europe. Nearly all the manufacturing is done on a heavily fortified island just off the coast of China. It would take a nation/company an estimated tech spend of $30bln a year for a minimum of 5yrs to have any reasonable chance of success in catching up with TSMC. Naturally, we have started to see that. It is only the beginning, as the pendulum swings back.
    </p>
    <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Pendulum III:</b> “I’ve been doing this for 30yrs and never seen markets like this,” said Goldman’s Jeff Currie, in a recent interview. “This is a molecule crisis. We’re out of everything, I don’t care if it’s oil, gas, coal, copper, aluminum, you name it we’re out of it,” continued the bank’s head of commodities. High commodity prices cure high commodity prices as both demand and supply adjust. But we’re used to this dynamic in a post Bretton Woods world. What we do not yet know, is how this process will unfold as the pendulum swings back toward creating higher redundancy.
    </p>
    <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Pain:</b> Exchanging low profitability and high redundancy for extraordinary profitability and just-in-time delivery is a pleasurable process. The cost, of course, is high economic fragility. And therefore, the return to greater redundancy will result in pain. After decades of pleasure, the prospect of incurring real pain to achieve our economic and political objectives seems hard to fathom. And that is why so few people believe that the US and Europe will be willing to impose crushing economic consequences on Russia or China, in a world with already high inflation.
    </p>
    <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Pain II:</b> The same thinking applies to the Fed. No credible economist believes the Fed would willingly drive the US into a deep recession to return inflation to target. Even those who call for another Paul Volcker, don’t see political appetite. And this means we are left to simply hope inflation naturally subsides with the help of a little economic softness. Even then, in a world with a pendulum swinging back toward greater redundancy, no one knows how sensitive inflation will be to economic weakness. Putin and Xi know this too. Which makes this time so dangerous.

      <strong>Anecdote:</strong> “This is many years in the making, decades,” said the CIO, an extraordinary strategic thinker I respect deeply. “The forces now in play are self-reinforcing, trending toward an extreme event.” Los Angeles sprawled before us, beyond it, the Pacific, a hazy blue, timeless. “There is a bloodlust that is brewing within the mob, and these things are ultimately satisfied, you see it repeatedly though history.” Far north, Canadian protests endured, a reflection of some deep frustration, conflict brewing within. “For all our posturing, the US has in substance abandoned the rule of law in the sense that virtually no one still believes that laws apply evenly. The rich and powerful are above the law, everyone knows. We don’t even really pretend anymore. We see it in politics most clearly, but business too. And when a society passes this point, it trends toward a state of each for himself, take what you can. Smash and grab. It’s nihilistic,” he said. “Dalio writes that there is a 50:50 chance of civil war in the US. He’s wrong. The odds are 90:10.” I remained quiet, more interested in listening than debating. In periods of great change, it is vital to consider many possible futures. “There were 600k Jews in pre-war Germany. Hitler killed 250k. The other 350k left, the greatest scientists amongst them.” Einstein was one. “The US will become the most dangerous developed nation in the decade or two ahead. Blood will be let. And it is unclear what form that will take, but these sorts of cycles do not reverse without a climax. You should be positioned to be a leaver.” And I smiled, laughed. Not at the subject matter, but at myself. “You know me, I’m a stayer, for better or worse, it’s my nature,” I said. “And my oldest two kids have chosen military academies, committed to service. Our country needs a new generation of principled leaders. I hope we can all play a part,” I said, optimistic but unsettled. “These things run their course,” he said. “You must be prepared to leave and know there will be a time to return.”

        “Tell the ones you love, you love them / Teach only what you know / And oh, you better know it well.” Charlie and I driving, analyzing music, the beauty of lyrics. Silver Linings by Mt. Joy is my latest favorite. A song about overcoming addiction, owning our failings, turning them to strengths, swinging hard at life, unafraid. We listened over and over, as we always do, line by line, OCD, exploring layers of meaning, inspiration. “Let’s listen to David Bowie’s Space Oddity and Ashes to Ashes,” I said, “We’ll follow the journey of Major Tom through both songs, his rise, fall, addiction. Bowie uses Major Tom to explore our need for heroes, how we tear them down, our highs, lows.” Charlie played the two songs. “So did you listen to Bowie back when you were in your prime Dad?” he asked, matter-of-factly, age twelve.

        <b>Overall:</b> “Biden Warns Putin of ‘Swift and Severe Costs’ of Invading Ukraine,” ran the WSJ headline. The situation sounds horrible. European stocks jumped 1.6% on the week, the euro fell less than 1%. Oil crept 0.9% higher -- nothing really. “Inflation, Ukraine Stoke Outlook for More Stock Volatility,” ran another headline. The VIX index rose +4.14 to +27.36, unable to break 30 on the eve of military conflict. “Elon Musk warns America is operating on borrowed time as national debt soars,” ran Fox. The benchmark for US solvency – 30yr treasury bond yields - inched up 2bps on the week to 2.25%. “Rapid Inflation Stokes Unease from Wall Street to Washington,” wrote the NYT, after the CPI jumped +7.5%, exceeding forecasts and broadening. Markets priced faster rate hikes, with 2yr treasury yields leaping 19bps to 1.51%. 5-year/5-year inflation swaps rose a barely noticeable 2bps to 2.41%. “As Protest Paralyzes Canada’s Capital, Far-Right Activists Abroad Embrace It,” wrote some paper, as Trudeau warned US Republicans to stay out of Canadian politics. The Canadian dollar rose 0.2%. “Trump’s Missing Call Logs Present a Challenge for Jan. 6 Investigators,” ran a headline, as the November 2024 political collision steadily approaches. “U.S. trade deficit soared to a record last year,” wrote every paper. Naturally, Biden’s approval rating extended its inexorable decline. Rumors swirled that Hillary would run again. And yet, for all the carnage strewn across newspapers, the S&P 500 ended the week -1.8% (4% above the Jan 24 low and 8.3% below all-time highs). Strip out the emotion and markets digested the awful news rather well. The S&P 500 is simply where it was 7mths ago. But 10yr yields at 1.94% are now where they were in July 2019, when the S&P 500 was 32% lower than today (Nasdaq was 44% lower). And we are left to wonder at what level rising bond yields will matter?

        <b>
          The Great Financial Inflation has compelled investors into passive portfolios in our view. Bonds are no longer assets to balance portfolio risk, as seen so far this year. Not surprisingly, investors are searching for replacements to bond holdings. To that end, we launched One River Digital Income last week – a low-risk instrument to generate yield in the digital ecosystem.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        1/ Portfolios, we have a problem. U.S. household financial assets have risen to nearly 5-times nominal GDP in the Great Financial Inflation. So great is the financial inflation, households find themselves (perhaps unintentionally) with a whopping 49.2% allocation to cash, cash-equivalent assets, and bonds (Figure 1). This comes at a time when macro policies are resolutely committed to multi-generational financial repression. For all the hawkish hype, bond markets are convinced that the next easing cycle will come in 2023 and that long-term policy rates will remain well below inflation. This is strongly counter to Fed guidance. We see no historical precedent.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        2/ So, financial markets are telling us that nearly 50% of household assets are expected to lose money in real terms in the decades ahead. It is not just a U.S.-asset problem – shorter-term real yields are a global phenomenon (Figure 2). The Great Financial Inflation has masked the misallocation – long gone are the days of diversification. A 60-40% equity-bond portfolio returned 15% last year with a coincident rise in equity and bond valuations. Bonds have taken on equity-like return characteristics – the 60-40% portfolio is unbalanced. No doubt, the drawdown in 60-40% portfolios to start this year was on par with crisis periods – we were only missing the crisis – with equities and bonds both sharply retracing in January.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        3/ Are digital assets a potential solution to balance portfolio risk? Yes. But the solution has a more subtle first step: yield. Directional exposure to bitcoin and the One River Digital Core Index seeks to offer diversification properties over the course of market cycle. However, shorter-term cyclical correlations are still quite high. Daily bitcoin returns year-to-date have a 53% correlation to US equity returns and a 36% correlation to US fixed income. Not all investors are searching for more risk, slowing the institutional adoption to directional digital asset exposure. Ethereum’s migration to proof of stake will mark a milestone, transforming ether into a bond-like asset. But even then, the yield from staking is low relative to the ether’s volatility.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        4/ A more natural first step for some investors is to focus on yield derived from the digital ecosystem. Ideally, a yield investment would avoid any directional exposure and offer an income-like cashflow that is familiar to institutional investors. It would bring digital assets to investment committees in a low-risk manner, a more natural fit for their mandates (What’s Taking So Long? (here). It was missing – an uncorrelated, low-risk, liquid yield fund without direct digital asset exposure. So, we built it: the One River Digital Income Fund. The objective was clear – deliver a low-risk yield solution in the digital ecosystem. The lowest end of the risk spectrum is the natural starting point – risk can be added alongside the evolution of investor appetites easily enough.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        5/ Digital Income is a short-term yield fund. The Fund seeks to generate yield by providing a U.S. dollar loan to high quality borrowers in the digital ecosystem. The loan’s safety is achieved by over-collateralizing the loan through high-quality liquid digital assets, initially only bitcoin. The Fund does not take possession of the bitcoin and thus is not a money transmitter, an important consideration in the context of future regulation. Instead, the liquid collateral is held by a third party with conditions on when collateral can be liquidated (Figure 3). Our process selects known, researched, and regulated counterparties. Investors are granted the added security by over-collateralization of a liquid asset with 24-hour margining, 365 days a year.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        Here are the four most common questions on Digital Income:
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>6/ First, what are the risks to the structure?</b> The short answer – negligible. Digital Income builds layers of protection. The over-collateralization means that a default scenario is recognized well before collateral values breach the par value of a loan. This negates counterparty risk. Digital Income also allows for U.S. dollar collateral, which can be used to buffer a cascading decline in the price of bitcoin. Further, the loan has recourse beyond the collateral. These measures are designed to add safety. Not surprisingly, our estimates of the “risk premium” needed to compensate for collateral risk is comfortably less than ten basis points. The yield is not compensating lenders for a known risk premium. Instead, Digital Income will seek to provide income to lenders for intermediating activity in the digital ecosystem. And we believe there is a shortage of high-quality lenders doing so.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>7/ Second, where does the yield come from?</b> Demand for capital in the digital ecosystem is robust, alongside high expected asset returns. This is the natural flipside of high asset volatility. In the early phase of lending growth, retail capital, such as yield-bearing digital deposits, were sufficient. However, as the system has matured, growth in loan demand has increased through digital banking partners, high net worth individuals, corporations, hedge funds and family offices. Active loans for Genesis Global Trading, for instance, are approaching $10 billion, an increase from less than $1 billion at the start of last year (Figure 4). Rapid and broadening growth in digital assets will require substantial debt capital, including attractive, low-risk rates for institutional investors.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>8/ What is the right benchmark to compare Digital Income?</b> Digital Income is a quarterly fund and will be compared to cash-equivalents such as the Bloomberg 1-to-3-month U.S. Treasury bill total return index. We anticipate Digital Income yields to be in the 4-12% range, varying pro-cyclically with the demand for capital. A rise in digital asset prices raises expected returns and the interest rates paid by the borrower, even with collateralization. Rates are driven by demand. However, it is important to value Digital Income relative to other benchmarks. One way is to infer unsecured funding rates from publicly traded digital asset companies. Five-year unsecured financing, inferred from one convertible bond, is running at ~4%, the low end of our expected range. Digital Income is secured and can still offer an attractive premium.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>9/ How does Digital Income fit into a portfolio?</b> This is a subtle benefit. Typically, credit and risk assets co-move. As equity asset prices decline, credit spreads widen. This is a mathematical truism of credit spreads– it is equivalent to being long a risk-free asset and short an equity put. But this is not how yields in digital assets behave. Figure 5 illustrates the implied yield in bitcoin futures against high-yield corporate borrowing costs. Most of the time, there is no correlation. However, digital asset yields decline alongside the fall in the demand for borrowing in sell-off periods for risk assets and widening in credit spreads. Digital Income spreads are counter-cyclical, narrowing as asset prices decline. This behavior is more like a Treasury bill than credit.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        10/ The beginning is a good place to start. That is precisely what we are doing with Digital Income – we are defining the lowest risk point of the digital asset yield curve. Doug Wilson, the portfolio manager, executed our first loans this week with research and operational tools in place. We believe that this will be a comfortable step into the digital ecosystem for institutional investors. And it will also be a natural point from which to migrate out the risk spectrum, lowering collateralization rates to enhance yields and moving into credit provision through bitcoin bond-like structures. Bonds are a problem, and we believe Digital Income is a solution.

        “Average hourly earnings ran at a +9.2% annualized pace in Friday’s employment report,” said the Oracle. “On a three-month annualized pace, wages grew +7.0%,” he said, alone in the desert. “For those hoping that the US will avoid a wage-price spiral, this report was no Quaalude.” But the past was not what I’d called to explore. Of all my sources, only the Oracle foresaw 7% inflation back in early 2021. And my hope was to glimpse what the future holds. “This year’s path is hazier with the Fed now in play. But it is difficult to see inflation below 7% for this year, and it is within the range of reasonable outcomes to see 10%.”

        <b>Overall:<b> “I have tried everything,” declared Senator Manchin. “It’s dead,” said the Democrat from West Virginia, lamenting the passing of Biden’s roughly $2trln Build Back Better program that would have passed but for Manchin and Sinema’s support. Fiscal conservatives cheered, pretending to appear desperate to return the good old days of pre-pandemic austerity. You see, back in 2019, America’s economy grew 4.0%, fueled by a 4.7% federal budget deficit. But then the pandemic thrust the nation into this brave new world. The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, powered by a 12.4% federal budget deficit ($2.8trln). And that followed a monstrous deficit in 2020 to nearly offset that year’s -2.3% GDP decline. These sorts of deficits add up. And sure enough, US national debt hit $30trln this week, up nearly $7trln since late January 2020. It made for a good headline. But of course, the Fed owns $9trln of bonds that it can hold in perpetuity, which means in practice, that federal debt is closer to $20trln. That still sounds like a big number. But nominal GDP grew last year by 12.7% (5.7% real GDP plus 7% inflation). So $20trln isn’t what it used to be. And if nominal GDP ends up growing +10% this year (4% real GDP plus 6% inflation), then $20trln is even less. Do that for a decade, even with a couple recessionary years of -2% real GDP and 6% inflation and we’ll have barely any debt left at all. But of course, you don’t lose passage of a $2trln Build Back Better spending program by a couple votes and end up spending nothing at all. And if you completely slashed the deficit, we’d have a depression anyway. So massive deficit spending will continue, even as its absolute value shrinks relative to the size of the nominal economy. That is what financial repression looks like. The whole time our central bankers will pretend to lean against the inflation. While the politicians pretend to rein in spending. And investors will writhe in pain. But the truth is, at the end of a multi-decade debt super cycle, this is the least painful of a few awful choices.

       <b>Trading Size:</b> “A few big hedge funds got blown out of their leveraged curve steepeners last autumn,” said the CIO, high atop his prodigious pile. “Then the Fed started sounding more hawkish, and the BOE messed with markets too,” he said. “The banks didn’t want to extend balance sheet to let any of us leverage up as we headed into year end. So those of us who wanted to put on big shorts couldn’t do it in size,” he said. “Then Omicron hit, and people got nervous, stepped away, rates came off. That was a fade, so we sold as much as the banks would let us.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>Trading Size II:</b> “So everyone came into January wanting to put their shorts on,” said the same CIO. “Omicron news from South Africa looked better, the banks were open for trading, and then the Fed got more hawkish,” he said. “That all produced the real-rates shock.” The most exposed assets got killed. “But look, C&I loans in the US are growing 35% annualized, broad money growth is ripping. Real-rates can firm up as long as the economy is growing. People worried the Fed would be hiking into a slowdown. But I’m not so sure that’s what comes next.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Trading Size III:</b> “Jan is probably a taste of what will happen later this year, in the teeth of QT, but we’re not there yet,” explained the CIO. “Cynics say the market won’t be able to stomach the path, and that the fear of higher rates and QT will be enough to crack stocks and credit, and make the Fed blink,” he said. “But I think economic strength may surprise on the upside. Then there are two wildcards: China’s zero covid policy will fail with Omicron. But there’s talk Beijing will release a new mRNA vaccine post-Olympics. If that allows them to reopen faster than expected, it’s bullish. The bear tail is that Russia crosses into Ukraine, and China has their back.”

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>Ageing Models:</b> “Here’s what’s going on -- Strong report any way that you slice it. We will start to see old ‘buffer stock models’ of goods and labor markets dusted off,” wrote Marcel Kasumovich, our Head of Research, messaging the team in real-time, analyzing Friday’s non-farm payroll report. “January is a month of massive firing. For instance, unadjusted payrolls were down 2,824k in the month, but the adjusted number was up 467k. So there was less firing than usual, which obviously translates to a big payroll gain. Why less firing?”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Ageing</b> Models II: “In a labor market projected to be super-tight, you keep redundancy in your staff,” continued Marcel. “Hours worked were down, a telling sign of this dynamic. It is precisely what is meant by inflation behavior. Inflation isn’t some daft equation with a linear linkage between massaged data. The behavior comes through things like hoarding. A few extra employees. More copper in the barn. Order a few extra widgets. Excess inventory is profitable in an inflationary mindset. The US has already crossed the Rubicon.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>Ageing Models III:</b> “The bond market has a very simple read - more front-loaded tightening, no risk of persistent inflation,” added Marcel. “2023 rate expectations +10-15bp. 2028 +2bp. 5y5y inflation expectations near the lows for the year.” 5yr/5yr inflation swaps closed the week -8bps at 2.40%. “And qualitatively, the inflation dynamics should be most felt in digital asset prices which should be supported by signs of self-sustaining inflationary dynamics taking hold.” Bitcoin is inexplicably +10% since the jobs report, even as 10yr bond yields jumped 10bps.

        <b>Anecdote:</b> I had written something intentionally provocative. About a theory most traditional economists despise, yet few understand. Modern Monetary Theory. And took great care to capture its essence, succinctly, stripped of my bias. Easier said than done. To examine a matter, requires that we observe it from many angles. But to properly examine a thing, we must also consider the observer. The former is simpler than the latter. So, without realizing it, we generally spend our lives studying new things, while devoting far too little time exploring ourselves, our biases, beliefs. There was a time, not so terribly long ago, when Ptolemy taught us that heavenly bodies revolved around the earth in perfectly circular orbits. The theory faced challenges. Planets occasionally appeared to move backwards. So, Ptolemy separated the sky into 88 independent domes and theorized that each planet moved in small epicycles around a fixed dot in its larger orbit. The smartest humans on earth believed this. But with the discovery of each new object in the sky, the complexity required to hold this theory together grew exponentially. In 1543, Copernicus published a book, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. It took 200 years and bitter struggles with the Catholic Church for his heliocentric model to entirely replace Ptolemy’s absurd theories. This is not a unique occurrence in human history; it is a pebble on the beach. With such humbling lessons, it is a wonder we still cling to any beliefs. Some theories we accept as being unambiguously true will someday be seen as the absurdities of antiquity. We just don’t yet know which ones. They live undetected in our minds, influencing, undermining. Which leads back to today’s economic models, which fail in material ways to explain reality. It may even be that there is no economic model to explain this unique time in human history. And to prepare for the investment opportunities that unfold when large numbers of people hold onto a crumbling orthodoxy, even as the evidence of its failure mounts, we must examine all sorts of alternatives. Just as we must explore ourselves.

        “The Fed bought $130bln of bonds so far this year. And global central banks bought $300bln already,” said Biggie Too, global chief strategist for one of Wall Street’s too-big-to-fail affairs. “We have a rate shock, yet they’re still doing QE,” bellowed Biggie. “There really are just two camps now: sheepish equity longs and stubborn equity longs,” he barked. “So you gonna buy 30yr treasuries with 7% inflation? Or buy gold when the dollar is going up? Who wants to buy emerging markets when the Fed is about to tighten?” asked Biggie, working himself up, bouncing. “Maybe that’s why equities have gone from being this thoroughbred, racing beautifully around the track, to a bucking bronco – and yet no one can get off.”

        <b>Overall:</b> Infrared tests of the ancient artwork reveal that Botticelli initially started painting Christ as a young child, hugged by his mother. But for reasons long since lost, during the year 1500 AD, the 55yr old artist entered his studio, turned the canvas upside down, started over, and produced The Man of Sorrows. From a few ounces of unremarkable paint, emerged a masterpiece, a haunting work. His earlier paintings were mainly mythological, The Birth of Venus, his most famous. Later, his work turned more Gothic, perhaps a reflection of the darkness that briefly descended on Florence. Dictatorship. Botticelli lived in a time resembling ours, rhyming, the Renaissance -- a period of breathtaking creativity, expressed with the tools of the time: brushes, chisels, pens. But even in periods that favor the uninhibited expression of human creativity, we wrestle with our eternal demons. Political conflict, rivalry, false pride, greed, stupidity. We see it manifest today in Russia/Europe, US/China, Republicans/Democrats, climate-change, crushing inequality. The Man of Sorrows changed hands over five centuries, watching our triumphs, defeats, in silence. An anonymous buyer purchased the painting in 1963. It re-emerged this week, selling for 45,400,000 dollars; a currency invented 282yrs after Botticelli died. The Sotheby’s auction price is +1,621-times the 28,000 dollars paid in 1963. Such a return is almost inconceivable. The S&P 500 in those 59yrs is +68-times. Gold +51-times. The US consumer price index is +9-times. But high art is unlike other assets, connecting us to genius, the sublime. And it reveals this truth: an asset with finite supply, but no intrinsic value, can become priceless, if only we imagine it so. Which leads back to our present Renaissance. We live in a period of utterly stunning human advance, expressed with the technological tools of our time. Today’s greatest creations will barely resemble those of the past. Yet all this is obscured from most by the distractions streaming across the newsfeeds. And our highest calling, of course, is to navigate the rising volatility, while quietly creating and investing in the treasures of tomorrow.

        <b>Brave New World:</b> “I remember when Obama said the US was out of money,” said Warren Mosler, father of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). “He and Clinton went to Beijing to make sure the Chinese would finance their health care plan,” he continued. “Paul Ryan ran around saying the US will be the next Greece and fall to its knees at the IMF.” Begging for a bailout. “Then there was Krugman, the New Keynesians too, they thought higher deficits would naturally lead to higher interest rates,” said Mosler. “All of them - every single one - was dead wrong.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Brave New World II:</b> “Then two years ago, Congress passed a $2.3trln spending bill,” said Mosler. “There was no talk of tax hikes to avoid insolvency. There were no hysterical warnings of insolvency and an IMF bailout. Who was flying to China to beg for funding?” he asked, rhetorically. “All that talk had vanished. The only consideration was whether or not this unorthodox-looking policy would spur inflation,” said Mosler. “And that is exactly the goal of MMT - to shift the debate to where it belongs. This sort of grand spending can be pursued, limited only by the emergence of unacceptably high inflation.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Brave New World III:</b> “For decades our politicians and policy makers have been looking at the wrong risks,” explained Mosler, having developed Modern Monetary Theory in 1992. “The risk of running deficits is not that the US becomes Greece, nor is it that markets will cause our interest rates to rise uncontrollably.” The risk is very simple, singular: inflation from excess demand. “The US runs its own floating exchange rate currency. Greece and the other euro members have turned themselves into the likes of US states that can go broke. The fed funds rate will not rise unless Jay Powell raises it. It will not increase until he decides to increase it. Period. Fact.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Brave New World IV:</b> “We’ve finally experienced a major shift in what drives policy,” said Mosler. “We are coming to understand what our true options look like,” he said. “We can no longer claim to be unable to build infrastructure, invest in the future, our people, education. We now know we will not need an IMF bailout.” We will never need to beg China for dollars. “Had we come to terms with this decades ago, policy would have been very different. But no matter, we have finally shifted the debate from where it was to where it is now. To the truth, to reality.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Brave New World V:</b> “It is important to reduce inflation,” said Mosler. “But just as orthodox thinking is wrong when discussing deficits, so too are the accepted prescriptions for tempering price gains.” Market are now obsessed with rate hikes and quantitative tightening. “Here’s how to slash inflation: introduce Medicare for all, repeal all non-strategic tariffs, negotiate longer-term energy contracts, remove all financial assets as permissible collateral for commercial bank loans (a.k.a. State sponsored leverage that fuels the casino economy - elevating financial asset prices, spilling over to other prices, tying up labor, etc), limit treasury issuance to 3mth T-bills, and set a permanent 0% Fed Funds rate policy.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Anecdote:</b> “We are only halfway done in terms of shifting economic thinking from a flawed model,” said Warren Mosler. “While we are no longer obsessed with a false notion that the federal government will run out of money, we still misunderstand the fundamental relationship between interest rates and inflation,” he said. “Our central bankers and the armies of economists who cling to decades of failed orthodoxy continue to believe that higher interest rates reduce inflation, and lower rates spur it,” explained Mosler. “They have it backwards.” Now, such a statement from a Modern Monetary Theorist infuriates most economists, because it invalidates nearly all their PhD theses, publications, Nobel prizes, their models, their religion. Naturally, investors tend to have more open minds. And this comes down to incentive structures. The cost to an investor of being wrong is rather high, relative to the price paid by an economist. And so, perhaps, it should come as no surprise that the general forecasts for both inflation and interest rates have been wildly off for well over a decade, with hardly any serious introspection from the economics profession. Were our medical doctors to perform similarly, they would no longer have a single patient. “Interest payments are universal basic income but exclusively for people who already have money,” said Mosler. “The only thing operationally that happens when the Fed raises rates, is that the government pays more money into the economy on a net basis. It’s the most regressive possible way to conduct deficit spending -- give money to people who already have it, in proportion to how much they have,” he explained. “This is the same reason that negative interest rates are deflationary. The ECB’s negative rates have the same effect as Elizabeth Warren turning $100 into $99 with a wealth tax,” he said. “Within the economy, rate movements shift income between borrowers and savers, but there is no large net effect, just different propensities between those cohorts in terms of who spends what.” It is marginal. “So, Powell’s rate decision is really about whether the government should increase interest payments. We’re paying $540bln/yr in interest now. Should we be paying $640bln to fight inflation? It is backwards.”

        “Growth is like fire,” said Lithium, hands free on Highway 1. “Fire requires oxygen, heat, fuel. And for the past couple years, the Fed provided oxygen, animal spirits supplied the heat, and government deficits were the fuel,” he said, banking hard, hugging Malibu’s sandy cliff. “Growth tech has been rinsed. Anyone who bought an IPO lost money over the past year. Bitcoin too. Animal spirits are being smothered,” he said. “Deficits were insane, we wasted $1trln last year, that’s coming down.” The Pacific sparkled to Lithium’s left. “The Fed will tighten liquidity, that comes last. Less oxygen, less heat, less fuel.”

        <b>Overall:</b> Powell reluctantly turned on the television, Biden’s press conference underway. “Covid-19 has created a lot of economic complications, including rapid price increases across the world economy. People see it at the gas pump, the grocery stores, elsewhere,” said America’s president, panicked, but careful, staying on script. “The Federal Reserve provided extraordinary support during the crisis for the previous year and a half,” continued Biden. “Given the strength of our economy and pace of recent price increases, it’s appropriate - as Fed Chairman Powell has indicated - to recalibrate the support that is now necessary.” Stock markets extended losses, the most speculative assets suffering horribly. “The critical job of making sure elevated prices don’t become entrenched rests with the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate: full employment and stable prices,” explained Biden, carefully pre-apportioning blame to the Fed Chairman for the Democrat’s House and Senate losses this coming November. Powell drifted back to simpler times, in 2018, when his job was easy, but his boss would berate him. “I’m just saying this: I’m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates,” Trump told the WSJ in October 2018, “Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates.” Powell considered how profoundly times had changed. In his 2018 hiking cycle, it took 225bps of rate hikes to tank stocks. But that was before Covid-19, economic collapse, and vast deficits, funded by the Fed. It was before inequality soared to levels previously undreamed of. Before supply chains were impaired, auto and house prices surged, inflation hit 7%, and real wages contracted. And it pre-dated the breathtaking hyper-financialization of the US economy, which meant that even talking about rate hikes now produces wild market swings. Such is the precarious state of financial markets that their prices are falling sharply because the Fed is verbally tightening, even as it is still actually easing. And Powell quietly wondered what his new boss would demand he do, if markets were to plunge, while inflation remains near 40yr highs.

      <b>Off the Radar:</b> “Market fears of rapid Fed tightening are occurring at a time when the central bank is still easing,” said Marcel Kasumovich, our Head of Research. “And the irony is not lost on the bond market. The rise in short-term rate expectations through next year is matched by the bond market’s conviction that policy rates will not get above 2% in this cycle. Something will break. But that something isn’t China or emerging markets thus far, as would normally be the case. The adage of the Fed sneezing and the world catching a cold may be fading in importance.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Off the Radar II:</b> “Nobody underestimates China’s strategic importance in geopolitics,” continued Marcel. “Many forget its cyclical relevance. In the past decade, China accounted for 44% of world GDP growth in US dollar terms. That’s ten points higher than the 34% for the United States and includes the 2016 period where China stagnated. The IMF’s best-guess is that China will contribute 25% to world GDP growth in the next five years, again higher than all other countries. When China says go, we all start to run.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Off the Radar III:</b> “The unimaginable is now a reality -- China macro policies are leaning against the Fed. While the US is embarking on a hiking cycle, China’s monetary policy is easing and prudential policies are being relaxed to support property developers. The potential for developers to use escrowed deposits for bond repayments was welcome news last week -- China’s senior real estate ETF, despite its very short duration, jumped nearly 20%. What is the root of China’s newfound policy decoupling? It is a gift bestowed by foreign investors.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Off the Radar IV:</b> “Foreign buying of Chinese debt is not a new story. But it is one with lasting benefits. The world’s second-largest bond market enjoyed near-record inflows last November, the first month of China’s inclusion into the World Government Bond Index. And index accountants expect another 34% increase in net foreign buying of China in the coming three years. The mix of those inflows is two-thirds governments bonds, one-third bonds of ‘policy banks,’ the ones that run bailouts. Policy bank bonds are the off-index addition investors use to add a bit of yield as it is considered close to government debt.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Off the Radar V:</b> “China’s international policy was patiently manicured for more than a decade to achieve policy freedom. And officials are not shy about the benefits. Last December, a Director of China’s Ministry of Finance, Wang Xiaolong, signaled that the record rise in planned 2022 bond issuance was part of a pivot toward easing; he emphasized that the “expansion and contraction of treasury bond issuance reflects the direction of macro policies.” The direction of causality is also clear, obvious in market prices. In a sea of red, CNY and China large-cap financials are bright green, rallying. Foreign inflows are the source of China’s policy flexibility.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Off the Radar VI:</b> “So robust is foreign demand for Chinese debt that local regulators are worried about instability,” explained Marcel. “Guo Shuqing, the architect of cleaning up shadow banking, warned of risks from foreign inflows last March. His caution on local property speculation was met with a prudential crackdown that did nothing to dampen foreign appetite for Chinese debt. Naturally, policy officials in the US and Europe failed to heed Shuqing’s warning of financial excesses. China listens to the Fed, not the other way around. Yet, unrelenting foreign inflows to a country that maintains an eternal option of keeping investor capital captive, shows just how different this cycle of Fed tightening will be.”

      <b>Anecdote:</b> “Here’s the truth,” said the Division 1 lacrosse coach, the two of us looking out across a sea of fields. “Of the 500 kids at this tournament, every one of their parents hope they’ll play Division 1, but only about three ever will, and I can spot them a few fields away.” He and I played lax together in college. Taught our boys the sport. “What are Jackson’s odds of making it -- be completely honest,” I asked. He watched closely. And I wondered how many subtleties the coach observed, intuited. The micromovements that top people in every profession come to see. Signs, signals, invisible to the untrained eye. After college, I dove into financial markets, and with each passing decade came to learn how little I know. And yet, with intense study comes a body of knowledge in every pursuit, much of it internalized in a way that makes it feel second nature. “He’s built right for a 12-year-old. Fast, aggressive. You’ll never know exactly how that’ll develop until he goes through puberty. You probably don’t see it, but I’m telling you, he’s two years behind in terms of stick skills. That’s the price you pay for living in Santa Barbara. Cali lacrosse is no match for the East coast. He needs to play with the top players. So, the only possible chance he has is if you move him back East. Then maybe. But that’s only if he really wants it. If he stays hungry. That’s the truth,” said the coach. That was 8yrs ago. “Our coaches talked to the whole team, one-on-one,” said Jackson, his first Division 1 season done. “They told me I’m fast, aggressive, my shot is great. But if my stick skills don’t improve, if the accuracy of my passing and catching doesn’t increase, then I’ll remain unreliable and won’t see the field,” said my son, still catching up. We all are, whether we know it or not. “I appreciate them telling me so directly. Now I know exactly what I need to focus on.”

          BOTTOM LINE (by Marcel Kasumovich, Head of Research, One River)
        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>
        Macro narratives are driving digital asset sentiment, from asset swings to regulatory decisions. This alone speaks to a maturing ecosystem – investors want the macro story. But digital asset volatility has been mostly uncorrelated to other macro markets in the recent past. It is more about a shift in investor behavior.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      1/ As digital assets enter the mainstream, market commentary focuses on price. And in a world where exchange rate volatility is near all-time lows, attention has naturally shifted to digital assets where volatility against the US dollar is breathtaking by comparison. The megatrend towards the digitalization of finance will not be defined by the shorter-term gyrations. The innovation happening more behind the scenes will dictate the secular formations. Recent advancements in the Lightning Network illustrate the quiet determination to digitalize finance.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      2/ The Lightning Network was proposed in 2015 as a way of scaling smaller payments, able to accommodate billions of transactions in a second (here). It addressed the tiring argument of Bitcoin’s inefficiency head-on. And after a slow start, user adoption surged last year with a 3-fold rise in network capacity (Figure 1). It is also integrating into the regulatory mainstream. This week, Bottlepay, a payment provider built on the Lightning Network, was approved by the UK Financial Conduct Authority. These new technologies can hold up to regulatory standards including anti-money laundering (here). It is a powerful example of technologists and regulators working together to encourage innovation in a complacent legacy system.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      3/ Innovation may drive the megatrends, but investors are still left to manage and explain portfolio volatility from digital assets. And just as digital innovation is garnering more institutional attention, so too are the narratives around the volatility of digital assets. Investors are looking for macro thematic narratives, including the sharp downturn since November and the abrupt decline to start the year. Explanations center on the downturn in inflation expectations, the Fed pivot toward faster rate hikes and balance sheet normalization, as well as the decline in growth stocks tied to the rise in real interest rates. The high correlation of bitcoin returns to inflation expectations last year (56%) reinforces a desire to put a tidy macro narrative to the digital ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      4/ But the analytics tell a different story. We run a simple empirical exercise to evaluate bitcoin returns as explained by three macro factors: market-based inflation expectations (5y5y inflation swaps), the inflation-adjusted terminal policy rate (5y5y overnight interest rate swap less 5y5y inflation swaps), and Nasdaq 100 equity returns. These factors only explain 10-45% of the variation in bitcoin over the past two years and with various representations of the data. More importantly, there is almost no relevance of these factors in explaining the bitcoin downturn since November. Those factors would imply a bitcoin price of 50-60k, much higher than the current price.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      5/ What does that mean for investors? Digital assets volatility has been largely independent of macro factors in the recent past. To be sure, the independent volatility that most investors hope for is skewed to the upside. But in assets where volatility expectations have ranged from 55% to 158% in the past two years, there will be plenty of periods where idiosyncratic moves detract from a portfolio. The test for any investor is asking about the structural trends. What tokens will prosper with the digitalization of finance? How broad will token pluralism extend? If the answers to the structural questions are positive, then downside volatility should be met with programmatic rebalancing into digital assets.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      6/ Of course, idiosyncratic volatility is not satisfying. It is a polite way of saying we need to dig deeper for an explanation. What is behind the swings in digital assets if the macro narrative falls flat? The hunt for the explanation is partly a process of elimination and partly identifying new patterns of behavior. There are three key elements of the market microstructure of interest.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>7/ First, the bitcoin forward yield curve has been stable, indicating leveraged trading is not a source of downside volatility.</b> Figure 2 illustrates the one-month annualized yield implied by bitcoin futures on the Deribit exchange, where leverage is more readily available to traders. A rise in speculative demand leads to higher forward bitcoin prices and higher implied yields (vice versa). In periods of excess leverage, forward prices fall more than spot as speculative traders forced to close positions at unfavorable prices. Last May, one-month yields fell to an annualized –75%, reflecting a costly, steep inversion of the forward curve to speculative long traders. On this downturn, the compression in yields is barely visible.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>8/ Second, option markets have decoupled from previous correlations to spot prices, with declining volatility expectations.</b> The one-week implied volatility on Ether is 70%, near the lows of the past year (Figure 3). Ordinarily, declines in spot prices, particularly severe ones, would have seen a surge in volatility expectations. However, volatility is low despite a sharp decline in spot prices. The same pattern is evident in 25-delta put-call volatility skew. The one-week skew in Ether options is only marginally positive, near the average of the past year. This is strongly counter to past downturns in spot prices, where option skew spiked well above 40%! Again, leveraged trading is not the source of the recent price weakness.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>9/ Third, a rise in the dispersion of digital asset prices hints at a change in investor behavior.</b> We illustrate this point with a unique parsing of the data based on the last two downturns: May 8, 2021 and Nov 9, 2021. Dispersion is measured by the median difference between the individual returns on the 12 assets of our Core Index and bitcoin returns. When Index asset returns are evenly dispersed around bitcoin returns, the measure is zero. The one-month dispersion in the latest downturn measures near-zero (–0.4%). This is vastly different from May 2021, where the one-month dispersion index measured –9.1%. Index assets exhibited higher beta to the bitcoin downturn. No doubt, two cyclical periods don’t make a trend, but it does call for attention.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      10/ Market behavior is bifurcating. It is evident in futures markets, where the decline in yields has been greater in regulated markets (CME) than in unregulated ones (Deribit). It is evident in active supply, where the percentage of longer-term holders has dropped alongside a more-than 20% fall in large-value bitcoin addresses (greater than $10mn). It is evident in the surge of interest in venture applications (here). Investors focused on macro narratives have mattered more than leveraged traders. And it is these ebbs and flows that should remind investors that we are at the very early stages in the digitalization of finance. It is precisely in those imperfect, inefficient early stages where megatrend assets are most additive to a portfolio.

      <b>Overall:</b> “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated,” said the Fed in their meeting Minutes. Stocks puked, the S&P 500 index reversing from Monday’s all-time high. Beneath the surface, those assets most geared to expectations of eternally easy financial conditions were savaged. Technology. Ethereum fell 20%. Stocks that gain when rates rise ripped higher as 2yr yields jumped 13bps on the week, 10yrs surged 25bps. “Some participants noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate,” added the Minutes, surprising most traders who rushed to recalibrate their highly leveraged bets. But for all the portfolio reshuffling and stop-loss selling, not a single market participant doubted that the Fed stands ready to bail everyone out in a market crash. Such conviction is well-supported by decades of repeated behavior from our accommodating central bank. And yet this cycle appears different in many ways that seem sure to make the coming decade differ markedly from all but one or two in the past century. Ever since the early 1980s, inflation has been moderating. And since China’s 2001 WTO entry, globalization has suppressed real wage growth for labor in developed economies, while depressing goods prices. So much else has happened too. The disinflationary backdrop allowed the Fed to ease aggressively in each crisis, and tighten in a slow, predictable manner. But in a deglobalizing world that is now shockingly underinvested in energy production, the Fed may face a crisis accompanied by high inflation that could prevent the rapid easing etched into market psychology. And this is one of the greatest known risks we face in the year or two ahead.

      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Casinos:</b> “This all started when Powell got renominated,” said the CIO. “The Paul Krugman’s of the world who influence Biden didn’t want hawkish rhetoric,” he said. “But remember, the Fed is a credible institution. Many pundits call its Governors stupid, but the Fed is no such thing. It will move, if need be,” he said. “And there is a bit of anchoring associated with the fact they have been fighting deflation for a decade and consistently underestimated the forces that kept prices low and stable. So sure, they’ll ultimately err on the side of being less hawkish than in previous hiking cycles.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Casinos II:</b> “Financialization of the economy is so extreme that it doesn’t take many rate hikes to have a meaningful effect on the economic system anymore,” continued the same CIO. “When you financialize your economy, and it is leveraged to your financial system as it is in the US, then you don’t need much tightening to slow the economy.” You certainly don’t need 5% overnight rates. “In this cycle, the Fed can achieve the same outcome as in previous cycles with more modest changes in rates and liquidity. It is on the march and it started a couple months ago, through the expectations channel.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Casinos III:</b> “Most people don’t understand how important the expectation channel is,” explained the CIO. “When your economy becomes a casino, players in the casino have outsized control over the economic system in that their forward expectations and bets start the tightening process before the actual rate hikes begin.” All the Fed needs to do is announce it is going to adjust liquidity conditions. “The betting market becomes a bigger part of the economic system. We’re not a manufacturing economy anymore, the US is a casino. And the tightening has started even as the Fed is still buying bonds.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Collisions:</b> “This year will be messy, volatile, far sloppier than previous years,” said the CIO. “First the market must adjust to the shift in the Fed’s stance, which will punish the most speculative corners of the financial system,” he said. “But that phase is well underway. The least profitable tech stocks excluding the FAANGs have been savaged.” Square is off 50% from all-time highs, its chart looks more like Ethereum’s than Apple’s. “This year, or at least this quarter, will be all about rotation, and beneath the averages there will be further carnage,” he said. “But we’ll find our level, markets always do.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Collisions II:</b> “Then next year we will enter a political dynamic unlike anything we’ve seen in a 100yrs,” continued the same CIO. “I’m glad there is so much editorializing about the political risks that are rising now. But I’m not sure even that can change the outcome. When you see the dominos line up, there is a certain inevitability to the change that is coming,” he said. “It’s almost like the housing crisis. In 2006 it was obvious that the housing market would crash.” But it took two years. “Now it is obvious that we are headed toward a catastrophic political collision. It’s so obvious but few people want to really admit it.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Anecdote:</b> “A massive technological shift is unmooring the center,” said the CIO. “Centralized authority and control are being eroded, undermined,” he added. “Our changing information systems are at the heart of this adjustment, making it increasingly difficult to establish truth, facts. And we have massive shifts to our energy delivery systems, biotechnology, our monetary systems.” The meaning of money is being questioned. “These shifts are undermining our institutions – government, education, economic and financial. Technology is shaking them all to the core. And as we move into this digital age, the employment base for huge swaths of society is being warped or obviated by technology at such dizzying speed that we are unable to process the change.” DeFi (decentralized finance) aims to replace the existing financial industry. Their payment systems alone will destroy roughly half the profits of the incumbent financial players. And that is just one example. Relative to what we were once accustomed to, such change is happening overnight. “Our brains evolved for a primitive existence and our institutions were built for life a few hundred years ago; new technologies are promising god-like power.” It is simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying. “And there is no greater incentive structure for the human species than to continue to press forward on innovation.” So this advance will not slow – the progress is relentless, accelerating. “We probably need a whole new set of institutions to meet the challenge of our new technologies, but not even the smartest people on the planet know what they should look like, let alone how to build and implement. And this is all unfolding in a highly leveraged world economy with inadequate supply chains and too little redundancy. It is optimized to a past that no longer exists.”

      <b>Anecdote (Jan 2011):</b> Pretty much everything I learned about climbing mountains, I learned from Vincent Ravanel. He’s 7th generation high altitude mountain guide from Argentiere, France. And from father to son, the Ravanel’s passed a simple mantra: “The Mountain never ends.” Like most things profound, it touches on something universal, fundamental. Because climbing mountains, physical and metaphorical, is what Man does, and has always done, and will always do. Vincent would calmly whisper that mantra high on the rock and ice when we faced a challenge, a fork, a decision. It served to humble us both, remind us to pace ourselves, and to only press for the summit if conditions and timing were optimal. It also served to inspire, to capture in a sentence our ambition to tackle something so large and enduring. You see, to bag a tough peak and return intact, of course you need skill/strength/tenacity, but you also need the right temperature/weather/visibility and a measure of good luck. Combine all those well, find the opening, push like hell, and bang – success. But fight the elements, force it, press your luck, and, well, you know the result. So I take a deep breath, and look up, a new quarter looms and above that, a new year, a new decade, a new century, even a new millennium. And on these first steps of this ambitious climb, I remind myself of the importance of patience and humility, optimal conditions and timing, and a little good luck. But mostly, I tell myself to listen carefully, at those tough and lonely points that surely lay ahead, for the Ravanel whisper, “The Mountain never ends.”

      Christmas Day 2013: “Santa slipped down the chimney. Left big boot prints in the ash that spilled across our hearth. And the jolly fella stuffed stockings. Built a train set too. Sprinkled magic everywhere. Moments before the kiddies emerged, sporting their finest bedhead, Santa lit candles, warming our chilly pre-dawn living room. And hours later, as Mara and I basked in the Christmas morning afterglow, Osama bin Charlie (4yrs old), filled with sugar and spice, turned to his big brother. “Hey, you want some of my crap?” he asked, and threw a rubber eraser at Jackson’s head, officially ending our Christmas.

      <b>Anecdote (Mar 2014):</b> “I knew that day, without a shadow of a doubt - I knew,” explained my new buddy. Before that break-through, before becoming a household name with $100mm+ in annual sales, he and his brother spent five years living in a van. Broke. Slinging T-shirts. “We didn’t care about clothing, still don’t, for us the T-shirt was a way of sharing a message.” And in search of something inspired, they turned to Shakespeare, Homer, Churchill, Einstein, Roosevelt. “We sought the essential source of strength in every great historical figure – and discovered the ten super-powers.” Simplicity. Humility. Humor. Creativity. Courage. Love. Gratitude. Fun. Authenticity. Optimism. “Throughout world history, no great people were pessimists, no one who consumed himself with all the things that are wrong with the world ever achieved anything of lasting value,” he explained, expecting an impassioned argument. You see he assumed those of us who ply dark-art hedge fund finance are out to destroy. A mutual friend had us hang out, expecting a colorful conversation. But much to his surprise, found we had little to disagree on. Because of course, the history of investing is a tale of the inexorable rise from lower left to upper right, dominated by those who possess superpowers. Investors have fueled mankind’s rise from the capital misallocation of King Tut to the triumph of Tesla. Some of us may side-step periodic corrections, even occasionally profiting from the fall. But the real money is made by betting on winners, funding transformational technologies, and salvaging the deeply distressed. Anyhow, he finished his tale. “With $75 in the bank, we printed 48 T-shirts with a smiling character and three simple words – they sold out in 45 minutes – hadn’t ever happened before, that’s when we knew.” You see, their message touched something in us all. Something simple. Profound. “Life is Good.”

      <b>Anecdote (Nov 2018):</b> “What the hell Charlie?” said Teddy, “Cover up your arms while we’re eating. Those sores are disgusting.” Charlie shrugged, too accustomed to sibling ridicule to be embarrassed. “That’s what happens when you itch mosquito bites,” said Olivia (15), an authority on basically everything. “And look at your fingernails Charlie, they’re filthy, no wonder you’re infected,” said Jackson (16), always game for gang tackles. “They’re not bug bites, and I don’t itch them,” declared Charlie (9), finally pissed. “You itch them in your sleep,” said Teddy (13), stripping his lifelong roommate of a defense. And while none of us believed Teddy heard Charlie itching at night, one look at the damage to his skin and it was hard to draw another conclusion. “Whatever you do Charlie, don’t touch the little one on your face,” said Mara, promising to cut his fingernails after dinner. On Charlie’s upper lip was a new sore. On his arm were another two, a few biggies dotted his legs. “Those mosquitoes really love you Chuck,” I said, and a wave of doubt washed across the table. “What if it’s something else?” asked Olivia. “Strip down Charlie,” ordered Mara. “Seriously?” he asked, nervous. “Jesus!” gasped the table in unison, his back and chest covered in circles. “Ringworm!” declared Mara. “You gotta be kidding me!” shrieked Charlie. But not one of us knew what that meant, not even Mara. Which didn’t stop her from Googling it, confirming the fake diagnosis, and treating it immediately with a fake remedy: tea tree oil. Such is the life of a 4th child, living in a home too busy to pay attention. And in a world preposterously micromanaged, eating away at our resiliency, we’re all better for it. At least that’s what Mara and I tell ourselves. “Tree tea oil? Seriously?” asked the doctor three days later, shaking her head. And Charlie laughed, prescription in hand, on the road to recovery.

      <b>Anecdote (Oct 2018):</b> The future is unknowable. Yet never has capital been so concentrated in strategies that depend on the future closely resembling the past. The most dominant of these strategies requires bonds to rally when stocks fall. For decades, both rose inexorably. And a new array of increasingly complex and illiquid strategies depends on a jump in volatility to be followed by a rapid decline of equal magnitude. They appear uncorrelated until they are not. Virtually every investment portfolio measures risk by utilizing some combination of volatility and correlation, both of which are backward-looking and low. But the present is knowable. The past too. And the multi-decade trends that carried us to today produced levels of inequality rarely seen. Low levels of inflation, growth, productivity, and volatility are features of this cycle’s increasingly unequal distribution. But cycle extremes produce pressures that reverse their direction. On cue, an anti-establishment political wave washed away the globalists, with promises to turn the tide. Such change is nothing new, just another loop around the sun. Now signs of a cycle swing abound; shifting trade agreements, global supply chains, military dynamics, immigration, wage pressures, polarization, nationalism, tribalism. To an observer, it’s neither right nor wrong, it simply is. Some see parallels between today and the late-1930s, which led to World War II. We also see parallels with the mid-1960s, which led to The Great Inflation. What comes next is sure to look different still. But investment strategies that prospered from the past decade’s low inflation, growth, productivity and volatility will face headwinds as this cycle turns. Those strategies that suffered should enjoy tailwinds. That’s how cycles work. And we know the 1940s was a strong decade for Trend performance. The 1970s was the best decade for Trend in 150yrs. And following cycle turns in both the 1930s and 1960s, the world became a profoundly volatile place.

      title: "Time To Retire Transitory",
      date: "December 5, 2021",
      content: `
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        “It’s a good time to retire that word,” said Powell, seated comfortably next to Yellen. Senator Toomey had asked how long inflation must run above target before the Fed decides, maybe it’s not so “transitory.” The Senate Banking Committee’s Ranking Member appeared as surprised as virtually every Wall Street economist that two consecutive years of 15% deficits, financed by Jay’s magic money machine, lifted inflation in ways that have begun to appear persistent. “I think what we missed about inflation,” Powell admirably conceded, “was we didn’t predict the supply-side problems, and those are highly unusual and very difficult, very non-linear, and it’s really hard to predict those things, but that’s really what we missed, and that’s why all of the professional forecasters had much lower inflation projections.” No doubt our Fed Chairman is right. There’s not an economic model in the solar system that could have forecast today’s extraordinary inflation without first predicting the “highly unusual, very difficult and very non-linear” supply constraints plaguing the global economy. But that is all now understood. What is not known is how monetary policy can or should be used to alleviate these supply constraints. For nearly half a century, the Fed reaction function was nearly linear. When the system deviated unacceptably far from stability, equilibrium, the Fed added new monetary tools. Forward guidance. Average inflation targeting. Whatever it took. And it is possible that once the invisible hand restores global supply chains, markets and economies will return to their familiar states. But having just retired the notion of transitory, the entire system appears to be moving towards a non-linear mode.

      <b>Thermodynamics:</b> “The interaction of inflation-focused monetary policies in the west and China’s mercantilist model created what I call The Refrigeration Mode,” said the CIO, sitting atop his prodigious pile. “The process has been ongoing for twenty years,” he continued. “The inflation-focused policy framework is based on the fallacy that you can model an economy using an equilibrium framework,” he said. “Wicksell was the father of classical equilibrium in economics. He observed that for a pure credit economy - with no external gold backing for money, just credit-backed deposits – there were no clear forces that would drive the system toward equilibrium. To the 19th century Wicksell, a pure credit economy was a fictitious, futuristic concept, but it is effectively what we have today - and it is a path dependent system.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics II:</b> “What is a path dependent system?” asked the CIO, not waiting for my answer. “Take the male driver when lost. Despite all evidence around him, the male believes he is not lost. He is, of course. And yet has no need for a map. The male is merely taking a different route, maybe a better a route to the same inevitable, incorrect destination. That destination being equilibrium. It’s all taking place in the male’s head. The reality on the road, meanwhile, is rather different. He turned left at the fork in the road when he should have gone right. There is, now, no natural force - other than blind luck and a tactful passenger - which can rescue him. Further wrong turns, and his destiny await. His destination is path dependent.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics III:</b> “So now consider a simplified schematic,” said the CIO. “The economy receives a positive supply shock which lowers inflation and allows rates to fall. This brings forward consumption. Consumers borrow and spend. Asset prices go up. Financiers get excited. More intermediation and engineering. We get inevitable excess. Policy tightens. This causes a financial crisis, which the central bank is forced to respond to - with the fear of deflation in mind - and rates fall further. The net effect is that nominal and real rates ratchet lower in a path-dependent fashion. And this leads to a monetary policy that is so lost we’ve had to create a new word to describe our bizarre destination: a world of financialization or more appropriately, hyper-financialization. It is the optimization of the economy around finance and asset prices - the fuel for the Occupy Wall Street manifesto.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics IV:</b> “Now let’s look at the other half of this system: China’s mercantile model,” said the CIO. “We all vaguely know the story here - we all tried shorting it at one point or another. China discovered the Magic Money Tree. They used it to build a manufacturing empire and stopped the magic escaping from the capital account. This was MMT used in anger. They repressed the exchange rate to take export market share and accumulated FX reserves in the process. These were recycled into US Treasuries, supporting lower US interest rates. They repressed depositors with negative real returns on deposits to favor investment over consumption. The consumption share of GDP has remained depressed throughout, subjugated to investment exports and government spending. No wonder property became the savings vehicle of choice - and seemed to be an everlasting bubble. Free money allowed a massively accelerated pace of industrial development, especially after China joined the WTO in 2001.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics V:</b> “China’s rapid industrialization and hunger for global market share kept deflationary pressure on durable goods prices for thirty years, helping to keep consumer price inflation and interest rates lower in the West. And the beauty of the Magic Money Tree was that China could insulate its highly cyclical industry from any default cycle. It monetized bad debt and preserved unprotected, deflationary capacity. The stock of money ballooned. Banking assets are now around $52 trillion. They’ve grown by about $40 trillion since 2008. They’re now twice the size of the US banking system and China’s banks have added the equivalent of the US banking systems in just eight years. This is what hyper MMT looks like.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics VI:</b> “The net result is that western monetary policy and China’s mercantile model fed off one another to give us this Alice in Wonderland ‘through-the-looking-glass’ transformation of massive monetary growth into a deflationary mechanism: The Refrigeration Mode. Both sides got what they wanted: China leapfrogging industrial development, and the US got low inflation in the great moderation. But it had side effects. A massive monetary overhang in China, hyper financialization in the US. These extremes are now biting back on the system through the political economy.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics VII:</b> “The Deflationary D’s may still be with us (debt, demographics, disruption, digitization), but the system dynamic is becoming inflationary and there are some new supply side shocks that aren’t deflationary for a change. Both sides are in reflux. On the macro policy side, we are seeing powerful social reactions to the extremes produced by The Refrigeration Mode. These extremes are feeding into the political economy. Whether it’s the ‘Tax the Rich’ dress at the Met Gala, politicians and celebrities at climate change marches around the world, or bipartisan support for China containment, the challenge to the status quo is clear and present. The COVID crisis merely poured petrol on it.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics VIII:</b> “It means fiscal policy is back in the driver’s seat - just as central banks put an inflationary bias into their reaction functions. Future bailouts are coming via Main Street, as much as Wall Street. And when monetary and fiscal policy combine, policy becomes more directly inflationary in CPI terms, not simply in asset price terms.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Thermodynamics IX:</b> “On the China side, the model is pivoting. Common prosperity in its ‘dual circulation strategy’ shifts the emphasis from a reliance on exports to a focus on the domestic consumer in regional markets. A digital currency will be presented as a haven of stability, while other economies appear to be debasing their own currencies. Deleveraging is a goal - so more defaults will be allowed. Profits will take precedence to export market share. So expect to see China continuing to export more goods priced at a premium, leaning against commodity price inflation. Taken together, all these changes transform The Refrigeration Mode into its reverse: A Heat Pump.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Anecdote:</b> “To prepare for the future, we must first reimagine the past in a manner that central banks won’t,” said the CIO. “So, what is it that central banks can’t imagine?” he asked, rhetorically. “Can they imagine being both right and wrong? Right that the inflation potential of the system is low due to the persistence of deflationary forces that are now well known, but wrong because their actions - based on this belief in deflationary tendencies - unnerves depositors sufficiently that they want to get out of the currency,” he said, the S&P 500 still within a few percent of record highs, home prices surging, used car prices too. “And can central banks also imagine technology being both deflationary and inflationary?” he asked. “Deflationary for all the obvious reasons - just ask the shoeshine about artificial intelligence and productivity – and inflationary because social media can amplify inflationary fears, while financial technology enables more and more depositors to switch out of dollars at the tap of a button,” he explained, countless buy and sell orders from a whole new generation of day traders, addicted to Robinhood, swirling in the cloud. “It could be the currency equivalent of a bank run in the 19th century when the mere rumor - true or false - of a bank losing its gold reserves, could set off a run,” he said, a student of the rich history of financial booms, busts, panics. “So, can these two paradoxes combine to take out a reserve currency?” he asked, concerned less by the immediate market risks, but rather, what happens when the next big equity market decline forces the Fed to ease policy while inflation remains robust. “Perhaps this will be how our story ends. A run on the dollar takes hold, the world’s reserve currency collapses,” he said. “It’s the explosive ending central bankers can’t imagine.”

      “My brain says jump, but my body won’t move,” whispered Teddy this morning, not looking at me, staring into the distance, the wind howling. “It means you’re thinking Teddy -- don’t overthink this, just jump,” I said, climbing my way out of the water, the rest of my little lemmings leaping off the rock, plunging into icy water. Charlie, Liv, Jackson. Kerplunk. Kerplunk. Kerplunk. Teddy closed his eyes, took a deep breath. “Ahhhhhhhh!” he screamed, flying, living. Another year of our Thanksgiving cliff-jumping ritual checked off the list. Teaching us that often the things we’d rather not do, are precisely the things we must.

      <b>Anecdote (December 2015):</b> “Cliff jumping,” answered Jackson, without hesitation, taking charge. Olivia, Teddy and Charlie cheered. Filling the air with the magic of mischief. I’d asked for ideas. We needed out. Thanksgiving had overwhelmed us. So we piled into the Suburban, in search of sanctuary, solitude. The Greenwich cliffs are hidden deep in back-country. And like so much in today’s wild, they’re forbidden. So we whispered our way through the woods, Wolfie and Shackleton sniffing for squirrels. Blazing our own twisted trail, freshly fallen leaves in our wake. Now, truth be told, cliff jumping in November was not the first thing that sprang to my mind. But having learned a thing or two about parenting, I know that in certain situations there’s no better time to say yes than when they think you’ll say no. So without overthinking it, I’d instinctively agreed. Electrifying us all. We first went cliff-jumping in October, on my 49th birthday. The sun bright, leaves brilliant red, yellow. Our screams rippling across the lake. The water unknown, cold. So with some mornings now blanketed in frost, we worked ourselves into a frenzy imagining the polar plunge. The cliff-top neared, the wind picked up, driving rain through the forest, drenching the dogs – we squealed with nervous excitement. Children allow us to relive life, if only we let them. And when we do, they help us see things all over again, afresh, the world anew; their gift. “My nuts are gonna turn to ice cubes!” shrieked Teddy, laughing, kind of. I stripped down. “Whatever you do, don’t overthink it,” I hollered, my greatest advice, the story of my life. They followed in rapid succession, my little lemmings. Screams echoed. The frigid water paralyzed our lungs. Fired our hearts. Breathed life. And what was once a quiet November lake, was somehow something new.

      “I need to decide,” whispered Biden to himself, struggling, unsure. “Lael is just terrific, no doubt, and her Fed wouldn’t dare cut off my funding,” thought the President, old enough to remember bond vigilantes. “But you can’t help but like Jay, a fine gentleman, a decent human being, and face it, he’s still buying over $100bln of bonds a month with CPI humming hotter than 6%,” thought Joe, having lived through the 1970s inflation. Heck, he was born during WWII and grew up during the post-war financial repression. “Hard to say we need someone more dovish than Powell,” whispered Biden. But of course, all such considerations were beside the point and Joe knew it deep down. The only thing that mattered now, was whether it would be better to fire Powell before or after the Democrats lose mid-terms. Because at this point in the cycle, Jay’s greatest political value is in being a scapegoat.

      <b>Overall:</b> “Climate chaos is an urgent threat to our health, communities and economy,” tweeted Senators Merkley and Whitehouse. “We need a Fed Chair who recognizes the urgent need for bold climate action. That person is not Jerome Powell,” they added, the scent of mission creep thick in the air. In 1977, following a horrendous run, Congress tasked the Federal Reserve with an oxymoron – a dual mandate with three objectives: maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. And having been born of original sin, into a world where 1+1=3, the central bank’s mandate quite naturally propagated. Slowly at first. Then faster. Until there appeared almost nothing in economics and politics that resided outside the Federal Reserve’s mandate. In 1998 it added to its mission the necessity of bailing out wildly overleveraged hedge funds managed by PhDs with more Nobel prizes than imagination. Blinded by math, they failed to conceive of the possibility that historically stable correlations could break for no reason but for the fact that markets inevitably find a way to inflict the greatest possible pain on those who lack humility. Ever since, in each downturn, the Fed bailed out such characters, always in greater size. It takes an active imagination to envision a world where the Fed is unwilling or unable to fulfill this mandate. Which makes this a real risk. But the central bank’s mandate expanded in far wider ways. In pandemics, the Fed funds the government and buys mortgage bonds, even as house prices surge. Some Senators now call on the Fed to “recognize the urgent need for bold climate action.” It is neither right nor wrong that the Fed does so, it is simply a mandate choice. And the central bank can do anything, everything, just so long as we continue to believe that money is real. Which of course it is not. And inflation is the one thing that can pierce the illusion.

      <b>Swipe:</b> “The past year has seen many countries promise to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. The next must focus on curtailing emissions in the coming decade. The 17bln-20bln tons of greenhouse gases that need to be cut by 2030 correspond to a 45% drop from 2010 levels. Even then, there would be only a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Yet current nationally determined contributions (NDCS) will result in a rise in emissions, not a drop, by 2030,” reported The Economist.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Swipe II:</b> It should be rather obvious to everyone at this stage that global governments, in aggregate, have no intention of meeting the emission reduction goals they set for themselves. That is in no way due to a lack of desire. But rather an unwillingness to pay the price required to meet the deadline. For the first time in decades, we are confronting problems that cannot be solved with the swipe of a pen. For as long as anyone can recall, each problem that appeared intractable was solved by kicking the proverbial can down the road and accruing more debt.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Swipe III:</b> How will national and geopolitics be altered by a problem that cannot be solved solely with a swipe? The global pandemic will be a helpful guide. Although a far smaller problem than climate change, Covid also affected all and defied a strictly monetary solution. Wealthy nations prioritized their interests over others. China deflected blame, intimidating any nation that dared press for answers. The most vulnerable suffered disproportionately. No globally coordinated effort was made to marshal every possible resource to tackle the problem. And to soothe the stresses, unprecedented sums of money were created at the swipe of a pen.

      <b>Don’t Know:</b> I don’t know why 10-year US gov’t bonds yield 1.55% when CPI is 6.20% and inflation appears increasingly persistent. I have some theories to be sure. But I don’t definitively know. Nor does anyone else. And I don’t know what the Fed will do if inflation stays high, but interest rates remain low. It might be that it does little, or nothing. And if that’s what happens, I don’t know why stocks and housing wouldn’t keep surging. But if that started happening, I’m not sure what would stop everyone from borrowing more and more to leverage up.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Don’t Know II:</b> And I don’t know what the Fed would do if everyone started leveraging up, while inflation remained firm, but interest rates remained low. If they hiked as gradually as markets now price, I’m not sure why that such an incremental rise would dampen speculative demand. If the Fed hiked to curb speculation in the name of promoting financial stability and this caused a sharp stock market decline, even as inflation remained high, I’m not sure the Fed could quickly reverse those hikes without sparking a run on the dollar, which would then lift inflation.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Don’t Know III:</b> But what I really don’t know is how markets start to behave when there are so many things that people don’t know. Naturally, there are always many uncertainties when it comes to such things. But the new set of unknowns we face today arise from the reappearance of inflation after many decades of dormancy. And because the economy is vastly different from when we last endured an inflation, while our financial markets are wildly more complex and interconnected, those of us who are being honest truly don’t know. Nor does anyone else.

      <b>Anecdote:</b> In my twenties I read everything, my religious ritual. The Economist, cover to cover without fail. Barron’s. Their roundtables. So many newspapers, my Sundays utterly consumed. Wall Street research, countless numbing reports. Week in review. Ahead too. Year after year in preview. If I learned anything at all, it is that there is no single truth, just interpretation. And it’s not that there is anything wrong with being well informed, but for me anyway, I grew tired of ingesting so many views. I don’t like being told what to think as a general matter, and having hit my natural limit, I increasingly turned to books. Not trading books, those had come earlier. Mainly classics. You will learn more about trading emerging markets from reading Nostromo than the entirety of all things written since Conrad published the novel in 1904. And you’ll discover a common structure to the world’s recurring business disasters in Moby Dick, although Melville published it in 1851. It may be impossible to truly succeed without Dostoevsky’s revelations as to what makes us human. Survival stories are another genre I turned to. Into the Land of White Death, written in 1917 by Valerian Albanov sustains me in the dark moments that periodically return. But of course, such masterworks do not connect us directly to the present. So in my thirties and forties I worked hard to cultivate relationships with others who had struggled to develop their own unique approaches. What connects each of these people is a child-like curiosity, passion, drive. An ambition to become better, which is impossible without introspection, humility. Such wonderful qualities can be found in the mature, just as they appear in the young. And unlike research reports and articles that tell you what to believe, such people share ideas, questions, facts and figures that make them think. Sometimes, they reveal those things they find most perplexing. Such a network, diverse in background, economic philosophy, political persuasion, investment focus, and trading time horizon, is invaluable. In the pursuit of an interesting life.

      <b>Overall:</b> “Inflation has become a political cudgel and it shouldn’t be,” complained Jen Psaki. But of course, fewer than one in fifty Americans could tell you what an ordinary cudgel is, let alone the political variety. Had Biden’s Press Secretary replaced cudgel with something more graphic, like a bone-saw, the nation would have at least had a chance to get the general gist. But her goal is to obfuscate the whole topic anyway. That’s the only way for politicians to survive inflation. Plus, you can no longer say bone-saw in the company of journalists. That would have reminded the White House briefing room reporters that the Saudis have been awfully quiet when it comes to increasing production to dampen today’s energy price inflation. It’s not that Biden hasn’t asked them to. It’s just that pressing too hard for increased oil production has become rather difficult for world leaders as they seek to limit the inexorable rise in greenhouse gas emissions. So, while China and India won a last-minute battle at the COP26, agreeing to “phase down” rather than “phase out” coal power, the weight of the political and economic establishment continued defunding fossil fuel production. Like all things economic, for every action there is a reaction. And it is often the case that the greatest long-term benefits require short-term costs. Vice versa too. So having pursued policies for the past few decades that prioritized short-term financial prosperity for a narrowing few at the longer-term cost of a widening array of social, political, economic, and environmental stresses, we now appear determined to right these many wrongs. All at once. To pay for it, the US has run annual federal budget deficits approaching 15% of GDP, more or less fully funded by the central bank. It is all well-intended, probably necessary too. But make no mistake, there has been no greater economic experiment in the history of humanity. It is no mere cudgel. This is 100% bone-saw.

      <b>Un-Orthodoxy:</b> “Rising inflation and growing government debt may not seem like the natural ingredients to lower longer-term real yields,” explained Marcel, our Head of Research, our investment team thinking through the opportunities that arise when the vast majority of people dismiss perplexing market movements as being illogical when in fact, they may reflect a paradigm shift. “Yet here we are – longer-term real yields set a historic low last week. It is not that the market has given up the idea of orthodoxy. To the contrary, inflation is imposing orthodoxy on people’s behavior. Despite low interest rates, high asset prices, and record job openings, consumers believe it is the worst time to buy a car ever and the least attractive time to purchase a home since 1982. Demand is strong. Supply is constrained. Prices gains are required to ration demand. This is orthodoxy, just not the variety we are accustomed to.”

But the issues are far more dynamic than linear demand-and-supply accounting. Take the last cycle of Fed quantitative tightening. Bank reserves held at the Fed peaked in 2014 with 5y5y real interest rates nearly 2.00%. Those excess reserves were cut in half through 2019 under the direction of policy. With the Fed no longer reinvesting bond maturities, the market had to absorb another $1.3trln of bond supply over that period. And 5y5y real yields collapsed to 0%, despite lower unemployment and substantial fiscal stimulus. Excessive global capital and the thirst for yield had a lot do with those outcomes and they remain strong today.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Un-Orthodoxy III:</b> “Norway’s central bank cut policy rates rapidly to the zero lower boundary during the pandemic,” continued Marcel. “It was the first developed central bank to reverse course with a rate hike in August. Longer-term yields rose very slightly as rate hikes were brought forward. But mostly, the curve flattened a lot. 30-year swap yields fell below 10-year rates in Norway, to the most inverted on record. Market forces drove Norway terminal rates lower with the earlier rate hike. These patterns are also evident in the UK. The hawkish pivot from the Bank of England did not lead to a bond market risk premium. Instead, before the first-rate hike occurred the market discounted the peak in policy rates in 2023, with an easing cycle thereafter. It is not driven by policy guidance.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Un-Orthodoxy IV:</b> “The market is signaling something much deeper – the scenario of sharply rising real interest rates is untenable. A material rise in real rates risks a severe, negative impact on broader risk assets. The bond market is telling us this would just bring a rush of capital back to low-risk government bonds. The bigger problem is that fiscal policy sees it as an opportunity. Negative real interest rates are being treated as an invitation to expand mandates and increase spending policies. The orthodoxy that is overwhelming the consumer is not even close to being on the radar of policy officials. The intersection of longer-term fiscal trends and the history of excessive debt remind us that policy orthodoxy is really the only answer in the end. It also predicts a very long period of negative real interest rates.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Un-Orthodoxy V:</b> “The US Congressional Budget Office runs a longer-term projection based on current policy, which includes a gentle normalization in real government bond yields. On those projections, Federal debt is more than 200% of GDP in 2051 with an annual budget deficit of 13% of GDP and rising. The debt interest expense, at 9% of GDP, is substantially greater than spending on social security and Medicare. It is not a plausible outcome. Spending will have to be slower and interest expenses lower. The history of fiscal cycles since 1875, documented by the IMF in 2012, provides the same lesson. How did countries absolve themselves of high government debt? A mix of financial repression and fiscal austerity. Governments used their ‘inflation dividend’ to run budgetary surpluses and real interest rates stayed negative for decades. Austerity comes before higher real rates, not after, and that isn’t near today's policy deliberations. Get used to negative real rates. It’s normal.”

      <b>Anecdote:</b> Losing money sucks. Lots of other things do too. Most of us hate being wrong. We go to extraordinary lengths to protect our egos. Which is absurd of course, but we are curious little creatures, taught as children to aim for 100% on each test, to win every ball game. At some point in a trading career, we either learn to deal with the humiliation of making mistakes or we fail. And the way karma works, the harder we deny our errors the more public the ultimate humiliation. Lots of investors target longer time horizons so that they make infrequent predictions, which means fewer possible mistakes to confront. Traders on the other hand, make lots of smaller bets, which guarantees frequent winners and losers. But for some odd reason, victories are less pleasurable than defeats are painful, so on balance, trading depletes us. Which is why it often destroys people, slowly devouring them from within. Survivors develop ways to inoculate themselves from the pain, humiliation, defeats, losses. Some train their minds to reverse decisions in an instant. They can appear confused, confusing, contradicting themselves in the same sentence. Such people are masters at self-preservation. The greatest traders and investors eventually build firms around themselves. Team efforts yield psychic benefits that help restore balance to the emotionally drained. Being surrounded by a group of fellow risk takers and business builders allows you to refocus your efforts when you feel you’re probably wrong. Uncertain. Or when you simply lack conviction. And a team gives you leverage to press hard when you feel you’re right and the risk reward is compelling. Because after years of focused effort, introspection, you gain a good feel for when you’re likely right or wrong. And you begin to see the same in others. Better yet, you can sometimes sense when others are wrong and stubbornly unwilling to yet admit it. Large groups of such people present the greatest trading opportunities. And as awful as it all sounds, the truth is, there is nobility in this struggle. Joy in the pursuit.

      “Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,” tweeted Elon. “Do you support this?” asked Musk, Saturday afternoon, providing his 62.5mm Twitter followers a yes/no voting app. “I will abide(n) by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes,” added Elon. “Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,” explained the world’s richest man, his auto company’s market cap $1.23trln.

      <b>Overall:</b> “Some have put the global figure between $100 and $150 trillion over the next three decades,” said Janet Yellen in Glasgow, speaking at the COP26, prying opening the Overton Window. “At the same time, addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity of our time,” continued America’s Treasury Secretary, and she is undoubtedly right. “These programs are exciting -- but as big as the public sector effort is across all our countries, the $100 trillion plus price tag to address climate change globally is far bigger,” she added. And you see, the cost already appeared rather small. That’s how the Overton Window works. Because “$100 trillion plus” somehow feels quite a bit less than $150 trillion. And once you say $150 trillion a few times, it honestly doesn’t seem so big. Afterall, when you think about it, that cost is spread out over three decades, which leaves it just $5 trillion per year. And that number used to feel utterly out of reach until 2009 when the Global Financial Crisis sparked the first $3 trillion US federal government budget. Of course, the deficit that year was $1.5 trillion, which seemed large at the time, but is just half of today’s $3 trillion deficit. And this year’s deficit is a wafer-thin-mint smaller than last year’s $3.1 trillion number. Besides, it only took the Fed to click a button to create the roughly $6 trillion to purchase nearly all of Janet’s issuance for the past two years, and despite widespread panic about the unsustainability of such an arrangement, 10-year interest rates remain just 1.45% even with inflation running at 5%, house prices up 20% this year, and the S&P 500 at all-time highs (+25% year-to-date). But of course, those returns seem small with Bitcoin up over 100% this year. And such a move used to be large. But Ethereum is up 620% in 2021, which isn’t actually that impressive when compared to its 3,460% jump since Jan 2020. That’s the kind of number that makes $150 trillion seem smallish. And in the end, it might be. But no worries, $300 trillion is just a double.

      <b>Standing Ovation:</b> The President’s Working Group (PWG) guidance on the future of stablecoin was published. It was a philosophical leap that makes the endgame crystal clear – a pathway led by US policy that invites private innovation into the existing financial regulatory architecture. ‘Wildcat banking’ issues will not exist under the PWG guidelines. US dollar stablecoin will reside inside the insured banking system under the purview of the Federal Reserve. The central bank can play the role as lender of last resort against the collateral held by stablecoin liabilities. Financial stability risks vanish. The private sector, not a central bank, is going to lead the evolution to a digitalized US dollar. America’s government/system deserves a standing ovation.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Standing Ovation II:</b> The PWG guidance also punctuates the philosophical divide between the US and China. The US is embracing private stablecoin as the scalable solution for the digital economy. The technology is working. Under the right regulatory framework, it can rapidly flourish. And it will. China has taken the angle of centralized control. Its private sector captured digital payments initially, and that is being outlawed in favor of a central bank digital currency. There are now 140 million individuals with e-yuan accounts, and transaction volume of nearly $10 billion. But there is no e-yuan appetite in the global digital economy, where the US dollar dominates and is now poised to rapidly expand. It is now nearly certain that China will lose this race for digital dominance, but in such an important matter, the US must press its new advantage.

      <b>Puzzles:</b> “Are we closer to the end than the beginning?” asked the CIO. “The is the first of two important questions,” he said. “When there are no investment losses of consequence in virtually any portfolio, you know the answer.” We are closer to the end of cycle. “And sure, some guys just got killed in leveraged bets on short-term interest rates, but that’s the only material loss and it means nothing,” he said. “Capitalism allows for periods of widespread investment gains for a time, but such environments cannot sustain. Inflation is the lever that derails the cycle.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Puzzles II:</b> “And this leads to the second question,” said the same CIO. “Will this inflation be transitory?” he asked. “If you knew, you’d also have the answer to the first question,” he said. “Everyone thinks this is how we should solve the current market puzzle.” If inflation is transitory, then the bull market can continue. If inflation persists, the next bear market looms. “But this is a very unusual cycle and I think we will discover that the answer to this puzzle does not run backward from inflation to the market, but rather, from the market to inflation.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Puzzles III:</b> “For the past few cycles, the Fed has served as the plunge protection team,” added the CIO, no stranger to buying into market declines once the Fed has panicked. “No one thinks the Fed will intervene aggressively to cap asset prices.” For decades, asset prices have been an input to the Fed’s models but only when they decline. Like all dynamic systems, the economy and stock market adjusted to the central bank’s reaction function, the former becoming financialized, the latter becoming leveraged. “Investors now expect to be bailed out - always.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Puzzles IV:</b> “There is an overabundance of liquidity and savings in the system now,” he said. “The liquidity isn’t just a function of the Fed, it is also personal wealth, and even for those without assets, their labor is in such high demand that they are swimming in forward liquidity.” When plumbers, roofers and electricians consider a big purchase today, they feel completely confident in their ability to pay for it tomorrow. “So yes, persistent inflation could push the Fed to tighten, sparking a bear market. But strongly rising asset prices could be the catalyst for inflation.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Puzzles V:</b> “If the S&P 500 doubles in the next 18mths, it would create not only a massive financial stability risk, but it would create an economic engineering issue too,” continued the CIO. “We’re at that point where there is quite obviously too much liquidity, wealth, savings, and if asset markets continue to rise at this pace, the feedback loop into the real economy will accelerate. The process has the potential to be highly reflexive.” Strong asset prices amplify wealth effects, this lifts spending, which boosts the economy, and inflation. “This is what forces the Fed to drop the hammer.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Anecdote:</b> “A capitalistic economy is definitionally a Ponzi scheme,” explained the CIO, a student of economic and market history, his fortune built by staying a step ahead, timing cycles, anticipating what comes next. “If it stops expanding it collapses. If the economy stops moving it suffocates, like a shark. That is why the Fed behaves as it does, intervening so aggressively, to stop this from happening,” he explained. “Even still it typically fails. The Fed proved unable to prevent the 2002-03 bear market which lasted for 3yrs. It failed to stop the Global Financial Crisis which endured for years in various forms,” he said. “But it did prevent the Covid crisis from manifesting fully, and that was for a simple reason – it was politically unacceptable to do nothing. There was a political consensus that no one was at fault. There were no villains – so we tried to ensure no one got hurt.” We name our crises for their villains. The 1980s Saving and Loan Crisis. 1994 Tequila Crisis. 1997 Asian Crisis. 1998 Russian Default. 1998 LTCM Crisis. 2000 Dot Com Crash. 2008 Global Financial Crisis. 2011 European Debt Crisis. In each, the villain was savaged, collateral damage spread far and wide. “The absence of a villain allowed for a policy response unlike any other, and this will make it difficult for most investors to appreciate the uniqueness of how this cycle plays out,” he said. “We will need far more tightening than anyone can appreciate. There is just too much liquidity and savings in the system.” Having tried and failed to normalize policy for years, the Fed is now planning a timid exit with the loosest financial conditions in decades. “Would it surprise me to see Tesla trade at a $2.5trln market cap? Nope. But assets are already ridiculously overpriced. And the end-of-cycle predicates are here: portfolios where no one loses, people think prices only go up, obscene amounts of wealth being created,” he said. “However, we don’t yet have material tightening. It’s coming. It could still be 12mths, maybe 24. And by that time there will be many villains.”

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      All great investment opportunities close gaps. In the most basic sense, they narrow the space between where a price is now and where it should be. The biggest ones appear when most of us see one reality, while subterranean forces are creating something quite different. When such gaps exist, markets tend to send subtle signals, behaving in ways that make little sense based on our understanding of current conditions. When such odd movements begin to manifest, most investors grow angry when they should instead redouble efforts to explore and open their minds to widening range of possible futures. I had a lot of fun considering all sorts of gaps and potential futures with Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman on the industry’s leading crypto podcast called Bankless: https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/89-institutions-are-bullish-eric

      <b>Overall:</b> “Your devices won’t be the focal point of your attention anymore,” said Mark Zuckerberg in his keynote, shuffling through a computer-generated landscape, renaming his firm Meta. “We’re starting to see a lot of these technologies coming together in the next five or 10 years,” he explained, server farms proliferating across the globe, humming, processor speeds advancing inexorably along parabolic curves. “A lot of this is going to be mainstream and a lot of us will be creating and inhabiting worlds that are just as detailed and convincing as this one, on a daily basis,” said the founder/architect, extending the epic journey of a firm first built to rank undergrad women’s appearance to one that now intends to construct humanity’s new reality: the Metaverse. Zuckerberg’s detractors went wild. “Meta as in ‘we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!,’” tweeted AOC. Others were less kind. But Meta carried on, making massive capital investments to win an intensifying war for its very existence. You see, Facebook, like every other organization based upon centralized control – which is to say virtually every institution – is threatened with extinction by a growing army of revolutionary entrepreneurs, developing decentralized alternatives. Incumbents across the most vulnerable industries are sending lobbyists to fortify regulatory moats from an assault by these innovators. Zuckerberg can hope for no such DC support. A wildly successful decentralized Metaverse would utterly destroy Facebook. So, before he loses his entire empire, he must build a wall around his existing network, and pray his users do not flee Meta’s centralized Metaverse. Meta’s longer-term odds of success are not high. And for those of us looking for frameworks to understand this emerging reality, the fierce battle between centralized and decentralized power is a focal point. The conflict will affect every industry, institution. And of course, understanding what is likely to become valuable in this new world that few can yet imagine, let alone understand, presents an enormous opportunity.

      <b>Does Anyone Care:</b> “Every policy-type person is asking – what is the cost of hiking interest rates early?” said Marcel, our head of research, updating us on the state of such chatter. “Historically, an extrapolation of rate hike expectations leads to a material jump in terminal real rates and an undue tightening in credit conditions,” he explained. “The most obvious recent analog branded in policy minds is the 2013 taper tantrum. 5y5y real OIS jumped from -0.75% in 2012 to +1.50% in 2013 with ~75% of that move happening on Bernanke’s misstep. A lot of factors contributed to the reversal – 5y5y real OIS returned to –0.75% in 2016.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Does Anyone Care II:</b> “The bond market is giving policy makers a free pass, at least for now,” continued Marcel. “Bloomberg headlines about bond market carnage are true for some micro, leveraged funds but not accurate for the broader asset class. Treasury total return indices were up on the week (+0.5%) and virtually unchanged for the month (-0.07%). If you told the market in August that the Fed might be preparing to hike in early 2022, most traders would have anticipated a harsh outcome for the broader bond market.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Does Anyone Care III:</b> “The re-pricing of the front-end is very narrowly defined. It is also clear in Australia where the 2024 bond with a 0.1% yield target now trades at 0.8% despite central bank attempts to hold it down. That kind of move amounts to a 1.5% price decline for unleveraged bond owners. So does anyone care?” asked Marcel. “The only players who do are those with leveraged longs. And these were hedge funds that wanted to be short bonds but tried to reduce the negative carry. They bought lots of leveraged short term bonds (sold vol too) and then shorted longer-dated bonds. That trade stung. But it’s a small group of players.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Does Anyone Care IV:</b> “The UK short-sterling strip tells an important tale of what is to come,” explained Marcel. “It says short-term rates will peak in 2023 and decline thereafter. The terminal real rate remains steeply negative. The bond market is saying financial repression is a permanent part of the financial architecture. It says that if you pull forward hikes to show you’re responding to inflation, there’s no possibility to achieve sustained, positive real short-term rates. There is too much capital in the world, and it needs to be destroyed. Financial repression is the most painful destruction tool as it provides no quick recovery, it instead stretches losses over a generation.”

      <b>Anecdote:</b> “Web 1.0 was flat, static,” said the visionary, unseating the slow-moving incumbents. “Web 2.0 arrived and was dynamic, interactive -- it is what we mostly experience today,” added the founder/CEO, lifting his phone from the table, looking at the screen, placing it gently down. “Web 3.0 will be immersive. And we will spend an increasing amount of our lives within the new worlds that it will open.” I’d zipped into the city for our meeting, on autopilot, handsfree, crazy stop-and-go traffic along the Hudson, software navigating the chaos at 60mph. “In these new worlds, our experiences will be virtual, the currencies we use will naturally be native to those worlds, the assets will be digital.” And he paused, thoughtful, entirely at ease. “When I started this company, I saw a future where early digital currencies would become increasingly popular, more valuable. And I expected these technologies would eventually prove useful and solve real world problems,” he said. “Even I am surprised by how quickly the latter has come.” Venture capital is cascading into blockchain companies that are racing to replace the things incumbent institutions presently do; only faster, cheaper, more securely. Some protocols are built to do things we previously considered impossible. Still others do things not previously imagined. These revolutionary pioneers see a world very different from what has been. They have a broadening view of what is possible. “As this future manifests, all assets will be tokenized -- the virtual assets we already see today, the financial assets we have always traded, and many real assets we never even considered tokenizing, exchanging, trading.” While we will split our time between the virtual and the real, all our possessions will gravitate to the blockchain, tokenized, fractionalized. “And we will supply the most trusted custodial wallets to secure digital assets for everyone in that future.”

        “I do think it’s time to taper,” said Jay Powell, struggling to be heard above the whir of his magnificent money machine, wet Benjamins flying off the press. $120bln per month. “But I don’t think it’s time to raise rates,” added the Fed Chairman, cautious, haunted by Bernanke’s Taper Tantrum. Way back then, in the Spring of 2013, bearded Ben, the Princeton Professor with one too many PhDs, dropped the hint that maybe, just possibly, he might potentially slow the pace of printing. Bond prices collapsed. 10yr yields jumped from 1.65% to 3.00% in a flash. That’s the kind of thing that only happens when markets are utterly surprised -- a truly rare event. Markets almost always anticipate policy announcements, whether from central bankers or presidents. Millions of global traders and investors - intellectually and philosophically diverse, intensely focused, triangulating, weighing, placing bets sized according to their conviction, their precious capital at risk, with the most talented deploying the largest sums, exerting the greatest influence - produce humanity’s only true artificial intelligence. A superorganism, as magnificent as it is heartless, vicious to those who oppose its verdict: the wisdom of crowds. “We need to watch, and watch carefully, and see if the economy is evolving consistent with our expectations and adapt policy accordingly,” explained Powell, doing his best to play the highest stakes game of his career with the weakest hand of any central banker in living memory. You see, for decades, the mega macro-trends of expanding globalization, breathtaking technological advance and favorable demographics, combined to produce a global disinflationary environment. This allowed central bankers to pursue increasingly aggressive monetary policies to moderate the economic cycle. Now we find ourselves at a point where central bankers fear making a misstep that sparks a stock and bond market reversal which would force them to come to the rescue in even greater size. The market knows this. And sizing up a tentative Fed, the market in its infinite wisdom taunted the Fed, pushing the S&P 500 to an all-time high. Bitcoin too.

        <b>1987:</b> The stock market crashed on Oct 19, 1987. Almost everyone knows this. Ask people to explain why it happened, they’ll tell you portfolio insurance combined with program trading created a structural weakness in market structure so that lower prices produced more selling. Some might blame comments on the preceding Sunday night from Treasury Secretary Baker. They’re probably right. But what most people will forget to mention is that the S&P 500 printed its all-time high on Aug 25, and in its infinite wisdom had fallen 16% before the crash.

        <b>Gulf War I:</b> Saddam invaded Kuwait on Aug 2, 1990. Oil prices soared. Coalition forces from 35 nations assembled forces in the region. On Jan 16, 1991, they struck. The CNN video images remain seared in our memories. Oil futures soared that night, briefly. Then collapsed. Prices closed the day down an unprecedented $10.56, settling at $21.44 which was 10 cents below the August 1, 1990 close (the day before the invasion). As a young trader, I watched in awe as the market destroyed those who over-leveraged themselves to an all but certain outcome.

        <b>1994 Bond Crash:</b> Greenspan held rates at 3.00% for 17mths which was plenty of time for financial engineers to construct highly leveraged negatively-convex products to boost returns for those who needed higher yields. The Fed shocked markets in Feb 1994 with a rate hike. Bond prices crashed, with yields surging from 5.85% to 8% in Nov 1994. But despite the cries of surprise, markets had started moving well before the Fed hiked. 10yr yields had already sniffed out the policy shift, sending a quiet signal, jumping from 25yr lows of 5.20% in Oct 1993.

        <b>9-11:</b> Only very rarely do terrible things happen when markets are in strong bull trends. When stocks reverse abruptly after a historic rise, it is usually for no apparent reason. Somehow, in some way, the wisdom of the crowd tends to sense approaching doom and prices start falling before something bad happens. Stocks were down 30% from the highs and 1.5yrs into a bear market when the planes hit. And stocks were 23% off the highs and 11mths into a bear market when Lehman went bust.

        <b>Covid-19:</b> The S&P 500 hit record highs on Feb 19, 2020. A month later, it closed 42% lower. Unlike so many tragedies, the pandemic hit with stocks right near their apex. Even so, the market had been sending signals that something wasn’t quite right. The S&P 500 rallied strongly in January 2020, yet implied volatility failed to decline. In fact, it moved slightly higher. For those who have suffered enough to learn to really listen, such signals are whispers to “watch out.” The market, in its infinite wisdom, is an imperfect crystal ball, but it’s the best one we have.

        <b>IPOs:</b> Coinbase went public April 14th. The excitement was extraordinary. Bitcoin hit a record high that day at $64,899. And for so many young traders who have yet to learn how terrifyingly efficient the market is at separating speculators from their money, the immediate decline in Bitcoin prices was terrifying. Three months later, after an avalanche of negative headlines and a move by China to ban crypto mining/trading, Bitcoin traded 55% lower. It made record highs this week as new ETFs went live. And once burned by a reversal from these levels, the market psychology and trading setup is quite different this time around. A new lesson to be learned.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Anecdote:</b> The market is never wrong. The price it produces reflects the collective wisdom of humanity, weighted toward those with the most capital at risk. And because money generally flows to those with the greatest aptitude, the collective judgement resulting from their aggregate bets - reflected in the market clearing price - does a better job than any other forecasting algorithm ever developed. But just because such a system is superior to all others does not mean there are no opportunities to profit. Most make the mistake of taking the market head on, trying to out-forecast it. They find their periodic successes heroic, thrilling. But in time, the odds destroy them. Survivors make money by studying market movements for decades, listening, watching, learning. Reacting to familiar setups. The most fundamental truth in the game is that for every buyer there is a seller. And vice versa. Before you go short, understand who will sell to you at a lower price in the future. The most reliable future seller is someone who owns something that fails to move higher even though the fundamental news suggests it should rise. When such longs get stubborn and angry that the market starts sliding, the odds rise dramatically that they will eventually puke at much lower prices. The gold market is a candidate for that kind of setup. People bought too much of it in a panic, to protect themselves from inflation after the 2008 QE money printing. They hoped their children would eventually buy it from them at much higher prices. But inflation finally arrived, and yet gold stopped going up. Now their kids are buying digital assets - they’ll never buy gold. And this also leads to a bullish digital setup. The most reliable future buyers of innovative assets are those who are stubbornly resistant to change even as it manifests, stuck in investments that are underperforming and in companies that are being unseated. So naturally, they will be the future buyers of digital assets and the infrastructure that they represent.

      “Before investing in a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts, make sure that you carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits,” warned the SEC via a Thursday evening tweet. Twitter blew up. Digital asset prices surged. Because of course, Biden’s SEC Chairman, who consults with the Treasury Secretary and others on crypto would only approve an ETF if they were going to let the market decide if bitcoin is here to stay. But the new ETFs will provide exposure to bitcoin that is almost as costly and inefficient as could be imagined, including because of the futures-related risks the SEC cites. And relative to the underlying digital asset markets, which trade 24x7x365, these ETFs will trade just 252-days per year on exchanges whose primary trading hours are only 6.5-hours per day. Such a vast chasm between the digital asset markets and our legacy exchanges will drive more investors away from archaic financial intermediaries to the new digital ecosystem. And all the excitement lifted bitcoin to within striking distance of its record weekly close – that is, for the sort of traders who still operate as if markets close.

      <b>Overall:</b> “Today’s announcement has the potential to be a game-changer,” said Biden, from the White House steps, directing attention to the Port of Los Angeles and its newly extended hours of operation. “Private sector companies need to step up as well,” pleaded the President, scrambling to grease America’s rusty supply chain. Nearby, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its consumer price index for September. The CPI rose +5.4% from 2020. And a few blocks away, the Social Security Administration considered the arguments for and against transitory inflation, then hiked next year’s benefits by +5.9%. That’s the largest cost-of-living adjustment in 40 years, and a reminder that the lags in inflation are integrated into public policy. In 2020, the inflation adjustment was just +1.6%. But that was before consumer prices jumped +5.4% – inflation cut 3.8% of purchasing power from seniors living off social security. And they’re not alone. This time last year, investors who sought the safety of risk-free 10yr Treasury notes (+0.74% yield back then) lost -11.19 % when measured on an inflation-adjusted basis. What connects these two stories is that both Social Security commitments and Treasury securities represent government liabilities. And the net present value of those liabilities is impossibly large to meet – in real terms, at least. So the government’s long process of lightening its burden from that real liability has finally begun. If successfully coordinated and executed by the Fed, Treasury, IRS, regulators and elected politicians, inflation rates will be guided to remain well above nominal interest rates for decades. That’s what the inflation-index Treasury market is signaling. By design, the process will destroy vast sums of capital because private-sector assets are the government’s liabilities. And our job as investors is to adapt to this new environment. The starting place is to view it all as neither good nor bad, but rather an inevitable process that simply is – a world of nominal illusion.

      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Lines:</b> After decades of coordinated government policy that prevented widespread capital destruction in each and every recession, we unsurprisingly find ourselves with an overabundance of it. Interest rates remain so low not simply because the Fed set rates at zero and buys $120bln of bonds per month. When there is too much of any commodity, its price declines. And until the supply of capital shrinks meaningfully, or demand for it rises materially, the interest rate that borrowers are prepared to pay for something so abundant will remain low.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Lines II:</b> Of the many lines that divide our fractured world, the darkest separates young and old. For decades, Baby Boomers advocated for an economic and entitlement structure that favored the old relative to the young. The ageing now overwhelmingly control societal wealth and have granted themselves entitlements that claim an outsized portion of future economic output. The young are expected to produce this for them. Baby Boomers also saddled their offspring with a climate crisis. And the young are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Lines III:</b> Much of the tension we see today emanates from competing interests between young and old. This gets obscured by those with an interest to divert attention. But economics doesn’t lie for long. And systems that swing too far from balance are usually drawn back toward center. So the pressures to deprive the old of the wealth they accumulated and the entitlements they granted themselves has begun. The path this process takes will define markets for decades. The fight will be wicked. Agonizing. It has started by haircutting the wealth of those who own bonds.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Lines IV:</b> The worst possible investment environment for wealthy old people is a high inflation environment with (1) very low yields on risk-free bonds, and (2) extremely high valuations for risky assets. Low yields deprive old people of a way to mitigate their loss of buying power. So they grow poorer unless they take market risk. But when asset valuations are historically high and increasingly disconnected from economic reality, old people who buy them run the risk that prices crash. Without income to recover from such losses, such a situation is rightly terrifying.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Lines V:</b> US inflation over the past year was +5.4%. Old people who own risk-free 10-year Treasury notes to secure their retirement lost -11.19% of their real purchasing power in that period (bond prices fell and inflation rose). Those who owned investment grade corporate bonds lost -4.8% of their real purchasing power. In a great irony that foreshadows the generational stresses ahead, old people who own gold to hedge inflation lost -12.8% of their real purchasing power in the past year (prices fell -7.4% and inflation rose +5.4%).
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Lines VI:</b> The people who maintained their real wealth in the past year did so because they owned risk assets. The S&P 500 return including dividends was +30.3%. After discounting that by the +5.4% rise in the consumer price index, the real return was +24.9%. House prices rose +19.7%, and on a real basis were +14.3%. Food price indexes jumped +30% over the past year, gasoline and copper prices leapt +50%, oil doubled, and natural gas surged +150% in the US. But few old people own such things. They consume them. And the one thing old people are unwilling to risk their money on is digital assets. Bitcoin surged 441%. Ethereum soared 920%.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Anecdote:</b> There are two good things about being young and broke. The best part of course, is that you are not old. But you also have little to lose. And that is liberating for a person with decades to recover from taking risk in ventures that might fail. Having a large group of such youth is an invaluable asset for the older citizens supported by their innovations and output. But powerful forces, if improperly managed, create havoc. So all successful societies strike a healthy balance between the competing desires of old and young. Nations that favor the former to the detriment of the latter suffer upheaval. This is roughly where we are now - nor are such dynamics limited to the US. And they are amplified by a world with a rising proportion of unproductive elderly. Our youth, in a system they increasingly recognize as profoundly unfair and biased against their interests, are doing as they should: advocating for vast spending programs to build a green infrastructure and social system that reflects their priorities, unconcerned by the resulting inflation that will erode the wealth of their elders. With powerful new blockchain technologies, many are building businesses to bankrupt their parent’s incumbent industries whose lobbyists calcify what our youth see as an unjust status quo. They are fleeing high tax states with bankrupt entitlement systems, for cities like Austin which they then remake in their image. As elderly gold owners writhe in portfolio pain, confused why the price of yellow metal is falling with inflation rising, our young people look to the digital future, buying bitcoin, ether, solana. NFTs. And as investors, our job is to recognize such trends, capitalizing on the opportunities they create, mitigating the risks such periods of upheaval produce. And in this new world, transitioning from old to young, unsettling inversions emerge. The strategies we previously turned to for safety have become risky. While unfamiliar investments that at first appear risky, provide safety.

      The United Arab Emirates has the world’s best performing equity market this year (+52.8% year-to-date, priced in US dollars). Russia has the second-best performing market (+33.6% priced in US dollars). Saudi Arabia is third (+33.5% in dollars). All three have a lot of oil, the consumption of which quite obviously contributes to climate change. Public companies throughout the developed world, and the stewards of private and public capital that fund investment, have raced to divest from firms that extract hydrocarbons.

      <b>Overall:</b> “It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills,” warned Yellen. No doubt. But the probability of sustained default is negligible because the constraint our politicians place on the national debt is arbitrary. In a fiat currency system, neither money nor government debt are real. They are illusions, mass delusions. This allows politicians to periodically bring the nation to the imaginary brink, point the cameras into a fictitious abyss, and then rescue us from a crisis of their own creation – all with the stroke of a pen. Markets barely budge in response to such silliness. They move on matters of consequence. As a rule, any problem that can be solved with a little ink is no problem at all – the world’s consequential issues cannot be remedied so. An undereducated person cannot become a highly productive, well-informed voter overnight. An impoverished community cannot become prosperous after a late-night negotiation. A depleted ocean cannot teem with fish upon congressional order. Such projects take decades, generations. The forces that produced Earth’s catastrophic 6th mass extinction will not be turned on a dime. Quite the contrary. And as humanity takes its first tentative steps on a century-long journey to temper our environmental impact, we are getting an early glimpse of the real consequences, reflected in markets. Underinvestment in fossil fuel production will naturally lead to energy shortages unless the transition to renewables provides a perfect offset. In a world economy that is as highly optimized as it is heavily subsidized, smooth transitions require enlightened leadership, public/private partnerships, international solidarity, and near flawless coordination. On a planet shared by 7.9bln individuals and 195 nations not known for selflessness and cooperation in times of great stress, the probability of extreme outcomes is thus rising. Naturally, technology and temperance provide the only way out.

      <b>Stop:</b> Peel back every great trade and you will discover a gigantic stop-loss. Some are more obvious than others of course. The $1bln that Soros made in 1992 by betting against the British pound required the Bank of England to trigger its own stop-loss. As humiliating as it was at the time, the BOE’s defeat unshackled the UK from an exchange rate mechanism (ERM) that was suffocating its economy for no good reason. And that is the beauty of free markets. They push us toward sensible policies that can withstand assault by those who dare bet against them.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Stop II:</b> Paulson’s trade in 2008 required the government to step aside and allow a cascade of stop-losses across the financial sector. The magnitude of leverage and corruption that fueled the housing bubble was so extraordinary that the cost of subsidizing a continuation of the status quo exceeded the price of picking up the pieces after its collapse. Whether the government could have better buffered the effects of the disorderly stop-loss or not is beside the point. The market did what it was built to do and cleansed the system to the extent that it was allowed.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Stop III:</b> Late on the afternoon in February 2018, the VIX index exploded higher for no particularly good reason other than the fact that a number of exchange-traded and structured financial products would suffer catastrophic losses if it did. Had the size of those products been far smaller, the market would have had insufficient energy to generate a move of the magnitude required to destroy them. But that is how markets work. They build energy as a major participant(s) grows weaker and stumbles. The dynamic is Darwinian.

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Stop IV:</b> Beijing triggered a stop-loss, ordering China’s energy companies to “do whatever it takes” to secure fuel supplies. Prices had been surging with natural gas up over 5x in a year. Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, a shift away from coal, along with myriad complexities in global supply chains conspired to produce electricity shortages. This hampered Chinese industrial production. Winter is not yet upon us. And half a world away, Lebanon’s national grid completely stopped and is unlikely to restart for days. It has run out of fuel to run its generators.

      <b>Anecdote:</b> “Always buy ahead of buy orders,” he said on my first day. I’d started my career in the corn pit because old-timers said I’d lose money less quickly there. “Sell in front of sell orders,” he said. Made sense. If brokers held large orders to sell corn at $2.50 per bushel and a buy order entered the pit, I’d fight to sell at $2.50. If prices subsequently dropped, I’d make money, and if they pressed higher, I’d cover my short with the brokers and break even. “But what you really want to know is where big stops are,” he said. When prices rose toward large buy-stops, you would get long knowing that if the stop triggered, brokers would be forced to pay any price. You’d sell your longs to them for a big profit. The same principles held true for sell-stops. Naturally, investors defended their stops from being triggered. Shorts would sell even more as prices approached their buy-stop, hoping to pressure the market lower. Sometimes their defense succeeded, prices fell, and for those of us who had bought hoping prices would surge higher, we had to puke into a market without buyers. In the most basic sense, that’s what pit trading (now called market making) has always been about. Through this mechanism, prices move up and down - triggering stops, inflicting pain on those who can least bear it, concentrating capital in those with the greatest skill - gravitating toward some underlying economic reality, which itself is always evolving. But that is not simply how the pit works. This is how the world operates. It is how we come to terms with our mistakes, like Europe’s ERM in the 1990s and the housing fiasco in the 2000s. Now we are grappling with how to mitigate climate change. The profound adjustments required will apportion historically unprecedented costs and benefits unequally across competing regions, nations, industries, individuals. Global markets will highlight systemic pressures, policy successes, failures. Helping us identify where to focus resources to enhance prosperity and forestall conflict. All of which is a pleasant way of saying that markets will do what they are built for - hunting the weak, ferociously, mercilessly, delivering to us prices that best reflect reality.

        “Is it your intention to ban or limit the use of cryptocurrencies, like we’re seeing in China?” asked Ted Budd, Republican congressman from North Carolina. “No,” replied Fed Chairman Jay Powell. “No intention to ban them?” asked Budd again. “No intention to ban them, but stablecoins are like money market funds, they’re like bank deposits; they’re to some extent outside the regulatory perimeter, and it’s appropriate that they be regulated,” answered Powell. And as it sunk in that the world’s largest economy would not chase China to stifle private sector innovation in the field of blockchain technology, digital assets prices surged.

        <b>Overall:</b> “All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they,” appeared unexpectedly in Xi’s empty mind, the Lao Tzu quote disturbing his morning meditation. Agitated, he inhaled deeply, pausing momentarily, his lungs full, in search of stillness. “Humility gives it its power,” further penetrated Xi’s thoughts, interrupting the moment. As a child, Xi studied the philosophical teachings of Lao Tzu, committing his ancient wisdom to memory. “If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them. And if you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them.” This of course, is the source of Xi’s greatest anxiety. China’s swift rise from utter destitution required the state to dominate the activities of its citizens. “Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield,” now leaked into Xi’s mind, his meditation a mess, haunted by Lao Tzu. “As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard.” As China rises and its centrally controlled bureaucracy flourishes, it grows increasingly brittle. All such structures ultimately do. “If you are untrusting, people will not trust you.” Lao Tzu’s words gnawing at Xi, his security state tightening its grip on individuals in ways that would’ve made an East German Stasi blush. Beijing’s latest technological vice is its central bank digital currency, which in a nation where the government remains above the rule of law, gives leaders vast new power over its 1.46bln subjects. Xi had naturally hoped Washington would follow Beijing’s lead, undermining the source of America’s strength - which is to defend the value of the individual over the collective. But now it appeared Washington would do no such thing. The WSJ reported Washington would instead seek to regulate private-sector US dollar stablecoin using existing law. Limiting government dominion in sensible ways. Paving the way for innovation. Xi sighed. “The world belongs to those who let go.”

        <b>Getting Real:</b> The US dollar is the world’s reserve currency. 59.2% of all official foreign exchange reserves are held as US dollars. 20.5% are euros. 5.8% are Japanese yen. 4.8% are British pounds sterling. 2.6% are Chinese renminbi -- slightly more than the 2.2% of reserves held in Canadian dollars. 1.8% are Australian dollars. The remaining few percent are various other small currencies that don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Swiss francs would be an example. Some reserves are held in gold. Someday, there will be digital asset reserves too.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Getting Real II:</b> For a foreign nation to hold dollars in reserve, it must first acquire them. It can either purchase those dollars in foreign exchange markets, or it can acquire the dollars by selling its goods, services, hard assets, or financial assets. There are consequences to such transactions. One of them is that the dollar’s value relative to other currencies is higher than it would be if these nations were not buying and holding dollars in reserve. Another is that by acquiring so many dollars and holding them in reserve, the US is forced to run a current account deficit.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Getting Real III:</b> When the US runs large deficits, it consumes more than it produces, buying goods/services/assets from foreign nations. This supports economic growth in those nations, job creation, etc. In a world of ever-expanding globalization, such a dynamic was seen as a benefit by almost everyone. Even Americans who lost their manufacturing jobs to foreigners tolerated this for a while. It fed easy credit and cheap consumer goods. Those on the losing-end of globalization remained subdued. That changed in recent years. And it is manifesting politically.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Getting Real IV:</b> Were the US dollar to lose its reserve currency status, it would decline relative to other currencies. The US current account deficit would have to shrink. In the extreme, US deficits would turn to surpluses – foreign investors, or the lack thereof in this case, would be imposing austerity on US policy. This would be an unmitigated disaster for nations that have built economies to export products and services – almost every nation in the world. So, would any of these countries want to see that? It’s hard to imagine why they would. And it is easy to imagine these nations would try desperately to avoid such an outcome. 
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Getting Real V:</b> So, if the cost of having the world’s dominant reserve currency includes running large current account deficits, having an overvalued currency, and losing manufacturing jobs, why would any nation want this? It appears no nation really does. The Germans buried their deutschmark by adopting the euro. The Europeans wouldn’t tolerate the cost of having the dominant reserve currency. The Japanese sell the yen whenever it gets too strong. There is only one other nation that has an economy that is big enough to potentially bear the costs required to shoulder the burden of issuing the world’s reserve currency – China.
      </p>

        <b>Getting Real VI:</b> China has several large problems. It is now ageing. Its working age population is shrinking. And unlike Japan, which became a rich nation before starting its demographic collapse, China is still quite poor. Being poor is rough, growing old is tough, experiencing both simultaneously is brutal. After spending decades building the means of production to supply the world with manufactured goods, it may be difficult for China to convince the world they have the fluidity to accommodate being the world’s reserve currency. The benefits to China are clear – the promise of more consumption with more access to global credit at comparatively low interest rates. But the costs are extraordinary and include a loss of control at a time when China is fixated on exerting its dominion.

        <b>Anecdote:</b> “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak,” whispered Xi to himself, refocusing on Sun Tzu wisdom, pushing Lao Tzu to the far recesses of his rattled mind. Xi recognized the near impossibility of his renminbi overtaking the US dollar, and yet there is value in having so many people believe this is his plan. The world’s nations hold $7.1trln in official US dollar reserves (22.7x the world’s $312bln renminbi held in official reserves). “Know yourself and you will win all battles,” thought Xi, recounting his favorite Sun Tzu quote, as true today as when the general wrote it in 530 BC, penning the Art of War. Xi’s decision to outlaw cryptocurrency trading was a risk he had preferred to avoid. It revealed a great weakness. When given the opportunity, Chinese citizens sell their renminbi to escape an economic system where his government remains above the rule of law. So, naturally, Xi restricted his subject’s ability to exchange renminbi for dollars. In the digital world, absent political coercion, the free market overwhelmingly chose the US dollar as the ecosystem’s stablecoin with 98% of that market’s $126bln now linked to dollars (representing over $100trln/yr in turnover). A large percentage of trading in US dollar stablecoin originated in China. Xi outlawed this activity too. “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting,” thought Xi, ordering yet more fighter planes to violate Taiwan’s airspace, distracting those who might otherwise see his nation as nearing the apex of its power, the world shifting away from globalization, as China’s working age population enters its inexorable decline. And now the US will allow digital assets to trade alongside its dollar. For all of America’s obvious weaknesses, it remained sufficiently confident to allow its citizens to choose. “Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across,” whispered Xi, beginning to wonder whether his adversaries would someday grant him such a path.

      “When you and I grew up, half the world was covered in communism,” said the CIO. “Global markets and international business provided the keys to liberate the human potential stifled by that system,” he continued. “When we started in the business, there weren’t vast pools of human capital moving piles of paper. But those days are done.” Too much of society has become financialized, optimized. Such a structure leads to corrupt incumbents, fragility, instability. “Markets and economics are no longer the answer to the world’s problems. And that’s not to say communism is the solution. It’s not. But it appears clear we’re entering the type of decade you see a couple times a century where politics dominate.”

        <b>Overall:</b> “Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,” declared the People’s Bank of China, increasingly desperate to ensure the successful rollout of their centralized digital yuan. “The government will resolutely clamp down on virtual currency speculation, related financial activities and misbehavior in order to safeguard people’s properties and maintain economic, financial and social order.” Beijing stopped short of outlawing the ownership of such digital assets. They prefer centrally controlled coercion, slow suffocation. One risk to outlawing the ownership of virtual currencies is that citizens who forfeit them are forever resentful. And states that turn their citizens into criminals at scale do so at great peril. Soviet communists turned such transformation into an art form. These are the stakes at play. China’s central bank digital yuan will provide Beijing with unparalleled transactional insight and financial control. It further intends to export this system as an alternative to the US dollar, directing business in China through its new international payments system. But the free market has already created parallel systems that lay outside of Beijing’s dominion. Bitcoin is one. Ethereum another. So are stablecoin. Such systems are built to meet market demand for digital versions of an existing fiat currency, such as the US dollar. More than 98% of the $128bln of global stablecoin is linked to the US dollar. Even more impressive, the annual transaction turnover of US dollar stablecoin is over $100trln. It is an astonishing success of blockchain technology applied by the private sector at scale. There is no such demand for the digital yuan – the largest private CNY stablecoin is less than $5mm. China and the US are, thus, confronting very different positions. China success in the digital currency arena hinges on control – the digital yuan will be used by decree. US success depends on regulators integrating US dollar stablecoin into the mainstream. They will. And when they do, these technologies will come under conventional oversight, unlocking exponential growth. Benefits will accrue to the nation with the currency that the market selects. That remains, unambiguously, the US.

        <b>Regime Change:</b> After decades, you recognize patterns. The biggest winners and losers in each cycle tend to be younger. Unburdened by the past, open to change, they often lack fear. Older folks who remain standing are either lucky or attained some wisdom, acquired at great cost. Pain. The most honest of those live in the fear that they have gotten lucky, and it will run out. Having recognized the impossibility of knowing the future, and knowing each cycle contains some new surprise, they surround themselves with younger people, blending the strengths of young and old.

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Chase Muller and Patrick Kazley on our team co-authored a whitepaper titled: Regime Change Resilience - Rebooting Risk Mitigation with Structural Correlation. Here are some excerpts:
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Regime Change II:</b> Beginning in 1962 when the daily bond time series is available and going through today, the correlation between stocks and bonds is slightly negative (-0.1 correlation). The t-statistic, or level of reliability of that full sample observation, is highly statistically significant with a -7 t-stat, where a t-statistic of approximately +/- 2.5 or larger is typically considered statistically significant. The t-stat being much larger than that makes it very unlikely to be a spurious finding over the sample period.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Regime Change III:</b> However, if you divide this timeframe into different periods, the apparent consistency and reliability of this observation changes drastically. From 1962-1981, when US interest rates went from historic norms to record highs, the correlation between bonds and equities inverts and is positive (+0.2 correlation). Thus, in Oct 1981 when interest rates reached their secular peak, if you had used a backward-looking risk model to estimate cross-asset correlations or build a risk mitigation portfolio, you would have assumed equities and bonds were positively correlated, and indeed the significance of that relationship would have been entirely supported through a statistical lens (+13 t-stat).
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Regime Change IV:</b> Naturally, you might be tempted to look at these results and conclude the relationship between equities and fixed income is indeed reliable, as long as you control for the rising or falling rate environment. However, the relationship and changes to it are not as easily predicted by a single factor such as the general drift of interest rates over time. To illustrate this, from Oct 1981 – Oct 1998 when rates collapsed from highs, the relationship between stocks and bonds was also positive with a higher level of consistency (+0.2 correlation, with a +16 t-stat).
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Regime Change V:</b> Lastly, the 1998-present period resulted in a -0.4 correlation between stocks and bonds, with a highly significant -30 t-stat. What we have not explored here, but is also worth highlighting at least in passing, is the potentially undesirable conditional correlation that can accompany transitory relationships. Even an assumed relationship that holds on average over longer time frames can break down in extreme risk-off events and lead to deeper drawdowns and more short-term pain. March 2020 was a such a case of risk assets concurrently declining and transitory correlations breaking down when they were needed most.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Regime Change VI:</b> Using backward-looking returns to justify cross-asset correlation expectations might yield convincing statistics, but ultimately this approach has not proven to be a fully reliable method of sourcing correlation estimates essential for proper risk mitigation and diversification. Indeed, without properly matching a statistical observation with an intuitive linkage, you run the risk of relying on ephemeral relationships for stability. This raises a question: If forward-looking allocation models based on historical returns are only valid in a world of relatively static cross-asset relationships, how does an allocator find reliable sources of diversification in the face of regime changes? 
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The answer is rooted in finding and adding sources of structural correlation that are resilient to such impacts. See the attached PDF to read the full whitepaper that examines the topic: Regime Change Resilience - Rebooting Risk Mitigation with Structural Correlation

      <b>Anecdote:</b> “I’m stressed Dad,” said Jackson, nearly twenty-years-old, preparing for mid-terms. I smiled, hearing in his voice the story of my life. “Stress is okay, drowning isn’t. Which is it?” I asked. “Let me put it this way, my easiest classes are Calc 3 and Physics.” I laughed, couldn’t help it. “What’s your favorite class?” I asked. “Matrix Theory for sure. My professor is awesome.” Jackson and I discussed Matrix Theory this summer -- back when I knew more about quantum mechanics than he – I explained how happy I was he’d earned the opportunity to study something so enigmatic. There’s nothing as gratifying as seeing our children surpass us. And I’d glimpsed the leading edge. “It’s wild the way he teaches, he’s young, unusual, incredible. He just told us the exam will be 80% what we’ve studied, and 20% things neither he nor we have ever seen.” I nodded. Young minds are sublime. The greatest teachers unleash them. Werner Heisenberg made his miraculous breakthrough at twenty-three, after a period of total isolation and fevered contemplation on Helgoland, a desolate island in the North Sea. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle opened the field of quantum mechanics. “Our whole class was like, you’re kidding right? Of course, he wasn’t. But I get it, he’s training us to think for ourselves under pressure, to see what ideas form, to stretch us. Maybe himself too.” Stress is the prerequisite for growth, the key ingredient for an interesting life. I explained to Jackson I’ve spent a career over my skis, getting myself naked short, scrambling to cover, over and over. That’s how you build a business, or anything for that matter. It is what produces the pressure to perform. In time you come to see stress as a gift, a lever. “Your professor is exactly the kind of person you need to fill your life with, that’s something I wish I’d learned at your age,” I said. “I hear you Dad,” Jackson said, laughing, “but at this exact moment, I’m just kind of wishing I’d chosen an easier major.”

      “The #Inspiration4 launch is one outcome of our nation’s partnership with private industry,” tweeted NASA’s deputy administrator, Musk’s rocket racing into orbit. “Creating a sustainable economy in low-Earth orbit including commercial transportation to space for people & crew and commercial space stations is critical to our future on Earth & in space.” Half a world away, China’s astronauts returned from a 90-day mission to Beijing’s unfinished space station.

      <b>Overall:</b> “All other geopolitical issues will fade into irrelevance if we fail to rise to the existential challenge that climate change presents,” said the former head of the United Nations climate agency. North Korea tested a new long-range missile this week. South Korea tested a new underwater ballistic missile. Taiwan announced $8.7bln in new defense spending. China sent more fighter jets across the Strait. The US and UK agreed to arm Australia with nuclear submarines. Beijing threatened to send warships into Hawaiian waters. But such geopolitical issues are not our greatest risks. They are just the most visible. Countries in North Africa and the Middle East import more than 90% of their food. Sub-Saharan Africa spends nearly $45bln on imported food. Brazil recently cut its corn crop projection amidst the worst drought in nearly a century. The number of people facing chronic hunger increased by 161mm in the last year. One in every three humans did not have access to adequate food in 2020. Global food prices in August were up 33% from the year before. Adjusted for inflation, food is now almost as expensive as it has been since the UN’s Food Price Index began in 1961. In the absence of a sharp reversal, the coming decade will see unprecedented mass migration. Today’s geopolitical issues will not fade into irrelevance if we fail to address climate change, they’ll be amplified. This simultaneously represents a monumental risk and opportunity. Fresh off a once-in-a-century pandemic which reminded us that we are all connected, a coordinated battle to combat climate change would appear to be one of the few things the planet’s 7.9bln people should be able to agree upon. With global interest rates at zero or less, and politicians prepared to spend vast sums, that’s our opportunity. Because of course, on a shrinking planet, straining under rising inequality, suffering from widening fissures, we are growing increasingly desperate for a common enemy. And history suggests we’ll find one.

      <b>Inference:</b> Allocators can no longer depend on bonds to offset the equity risk in their portfolios, said the CIO to his team, stating the obvious. We can debate whether the Fed will normalize interest rates in the coming decade – and I sincerely doubt they can – but we know for sure that they will not be able to do that in coming few years without causing a simultaneous stock and bond market collapse. We should be confident that the Fed won’t do that. So we can lean on that assumption in our portfolio construction. But let’s think about where else this may lead us.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Inference II:</b> In previous cycles, when equities were at records, bonds offered reasonable returns relative to today, said the CIO, still discussing markets with his team. For allocators who wanted to play it real safe, they could buy short-dated bonds and at least break even after accounting for inflation. But now, hiding at the short end guarantees deeply negative real returns. Some investors are willing to lose money for short periods to mitigate bigger risks elsewhere in their portfolios. But almost none are prepared to lose money in a trade that appears structural. And the starting point is a portfolio overallocated to bonds and cash.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Inference III:</b> We see increasing interest in diversifying solutions from the world’s largest allocators, continued the CIO. It’s far more demand for such strategies than we’ve ever seen. The common driver is these investors recognize the 60:40 portfolio no longer works. Owning bonds at deeply negative real rates guarantees a loss. And in a crisis, bonds no longer provide material positive convexity. But investors still need to take substantial equity risk to generate their required returns. So they are looking for unique ways to replace their bonds - and there are few.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Inference IV:</b> If we list every firm in the world that offers diversifying strategies and estimate their combined capacity to deliver the convexity that bonds offered in the past, what would we conclude? the CIO asked rhetorically. The answer is that there is a small fraction of what is needed to do the job. So what does that tell us about what may happen? A decent number of passive investors will stick with the 60:40 even if its broken. Proactive investors will replace their bonds with more unique diversifiers. But there’s another possibility.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Inference V:</b> Some investors may conclude they are unwilling to suffer deeply negative real returns. They will sell their bonds. Instead of buying unique diversifiers, they may instead go all-in and reinvest the proceeds from their bond sales into equities (public, private, venture). This inflow will push stock prices higher. Investors that pursue this strategy will initially outperform their peers, which will in turn pressure their competitors to pursue it lest they be left behind. Such a process holds the potential to be highly reflexive. Prone to wild moves. Unprecedented boom, perhaps. Bust.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Inference VI:</b> What’s the chance such a process will unfold? asked the CIO. In a world with unprecedented bond supply, negative interest rates, high inflation, and the reluctance of central bankers to normalize monetary policy, I would assign a probability of at least 25%. Possibly higher. Perhaps the process is already underway. If it takes hold, it will first appear as a stable paradigm. Over time it would grow increasingly fragile. The Fed would fear financial instability but would be extremely reluctant to intervene. Eventually, it would be forced to.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Anecdote:</b> “There are numerous ways to look at current circumstances in an area of change,” said the Chairman. “When analyzing an area, it’s helpful to consider at least a few, and explore how we develop our various opinions,” he continued. “What we often discover is that our perspectives are path dependent. How we got here, dominates how we view the future.” We were discussing blockchain technology, its power to transform finance. “As a thought experiment, picture a world where applications for blockchain technology were developed at one of our largest banks. They were patented, licensed, and then utilized by the banking system to increase the efficiency of settlement, reporting, operations, value transfer, custody, financial stability, anti-money laundering, crime enforcement, etc.” I nodded. “The industry raced to apply the new technology fully, tokenizing all assets so they could move through the system, comparatively free of friction.” Global financial assets are an estimated $223trln (including non-financial wealth an estimated $418trln). “Picture that the advance to this tokenized world stripped out market inefficiencies, waste, middlemen, rent seekers in the largest, most liquid financial markets. This created industry disruption, winners, losers, with most of the benefits ultimately accruing to society. And the innovators who brought that world to life were widely celebrated,” said the Chairman. “That would have been the “incumbent markets first” path. And imagine on that path, all sorts of innovation beyond our core markets inevitably popped up. Private sector creativity was unleashed, and cryptocurrency was one of many novel creations in that world.” I agreed this was easy to visualize. “But that world doesn’t exist. The real journey didn’t end with a novel cryptocurrency, it started with one, and this no doubt shaped opinion in ways that led to a much wider, more emotional spectrum of views, including zealous, often blinkered, pursuit of change as well as stiff, often blunt, public and private sector resistance to so much of what blockchain has to offer,” he said. “It appears many opinions on this issue were formed not on the merits of the technology, but rather, they were swayed by the path. In my experience the path matters a great deal in the short term but not over decades, those kinds of polar opposite opinions on the future fall away or are moderated by tangible successes and failures,” said the Chairman. “History tells us that those who best adapt to change have a sense of where various paths converge over time. The more and more quickly incumbent markets adopt blockchain technology the more quickly that convergence.”

      title: "The Case for Quantum Change",
      date: "September 12, 2021",
      content: `
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Change is the great constant in human existence. And yet, for reasons we will perhaps never fully understand, we seek its opposite - stability - a state that does not exist. In fact, stability is the one thing we cannot have no matter how hard we strive to secure it. All we can hope to attain is the illusion, so we conjure it, and shelter within. Even still, change finds us, we cannot escape. The passing of another day in a short human life. The gentle shift from summer’s green leaves to September’s hint of yellows, reds. Then one day we find ourselves suddenly old. Engulfed in autumn’s peak.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Some change is undeniable, quantum, jarring. At least we perceive it so. An earthquake shocks, a raging forest fire too. While the forces that lead to such events are imperceptible, their outcome is inevitable, time uncertain. Silent subterranean pressures. Drying tinder. An invisible rise in atmospheric CO2, a warming ocean, the ferocious hurricane. Persistent forces quietly at work, compounding. These dynamics are not limited to the natural world. The intentions of individuals and human culture unleash the same grinding force. It is as much a part of us as we are a part of nature, which is to say, inseparable. Perhaps someday we will break free from the pattern of our origin; so far, there is scant evidence to suggest it.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Each of us, at our core is a mystery; to those around us, to ourselves. Yet nearly all our behaviors are predictable, exploitable. The success of nearly every organization relies on harnessing the power of predicting behaviors. Governments, religions, militaries, corporations, central banks, universities, etc. These organizations maintain control by understanding how to manipulate us at scale. Having attained power, they are unwilling to relinquish it. Established organizations therefore actively oppose substantial change. It is their existential threat.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Those with the courage and conviction to execute on innovative ideas change the world. They are ridiculed at first, dismissed, sometimes persecuted. Socrates. Galileo. A few break barriers, and are afterwards celebrated, sometimes enriched. Einstein. Edison. Even though the rest of us operate at lower altitudes, we too are sublime enigmas, each in our own way. So, although our behaviors are nearly always predictable, they are not entirely. And that is why, when connecting millions or billions of such creatures, we can often model the near future with reasonable accuracy but must recognize that the more distant horizon is highly uncertain.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      And this leads me to investing.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      There are many investor types. At one end of the spectrum are those who identify tiny anomalies in the prices of various securities and bet they will revert to mean. Such investing requires relatively little imagination, and therefore, enormous leverage is required to generate meaningful returns. At the other extreme are early-stage venture investors who are skilled at recognizing a changing world. They themselves do not generally conceive of that different future; rather, they see it through the eyes of visionaries who do, and then provide modest sums of capital to build it. Their unlevered returns can be enormous. More artistically minded people are often drawn to this investing style.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Between those poles are countless others. Each bet on outcomes they see as probable relative to what is priced into markets. The biggest obstacle to an investor’s success is in overcoming their own biases, weaknesses, shortcomings. That’s no small task. The fact that most human behavior is predictable extends to our market interactions. The central tendency of most creatures is to follow - traveling in packs, herds, flocks, schools, tribes. This is why most successful investors tend to be deeply introspective. Their study of human nature helps them step outside of themselves. Iconoclast, they learn to lean against the crowd when risks rise wildly relative to rewards, or the inverse. They jump on macro mega-trends as the world begins to change while the herd resists.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      But major transitions rarely happen. So, most investors bet heavily on tomorrow closely resembling today. Simple statistics point to this as the optimal path. It is especially true at the end of major cycles, when the rewards for predicting a continuation of the status quo have persisted for so long that they appear structural, perpetual. Returns for those bets compress through time, requiring investors to explicitly and implicitly leverage their portfolios to sustain performance. When the world changes, they are devastated. Great fortunes are made and lost in the transitions from one cycle to the next as a result. While we often view such episodes as isolated events, they are phases within a cycle, parts of a process, connecting what had come before to what inevitably follows.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      And this takes us to the profound shifts now underway.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Investors tend to look at last year’s market collapse as a Black Swan. But it should be viewed as the final phase in a process that started in the late 1980s. An epic earthquake, decades in making. By early 2020, it was evident that monetary easing combined with central bank bond buying was no longer sufficient to spur the real economy on its own. To be sure, rate cuts and quantitative easing could lift asset prices if applied aggressively, but this in turn amplified inequality which contributed to the underlying conditions that afflicted the real economy. The Fed itself was crying out for politicians to engage in aggressive fiscal expansion.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The central bank’s well intended efforts to meet its dual mandate meant it did whatever was necessary to support stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. This had the unintended consequence of relieving politicians of making hard policy choices. The Fed stood ready to offset any and every economic interruption, leaving politicians under little pressure to act in the long-term best interest of the nation. With de minimis political costs of inaction, very little good happened. Special interests feasted. Leadership withered. The body politic followed, frayed.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The problem was not confined to the United States. It had become a global phenomenon. Decades of U.S. dollar dominance as the global reserve currency forced every developed nation to adopt the Fed’s general approach to monetary policy. Failure to do so resulted in currency appreciation, which in turn hurt international trade. In a world fixated on ever-expanding globalization, such a consequence was universally viewed as unacceptable. So, over the decades, global monetary policy converged with Fed policy.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The world thereby entered 2020 with a level of global policy homogeneity unlike any previously experienced. That policy no longer worked. The pandemic provided the most potent catalyst imaginable to catapult developed economies into an entirely new policy paradigm. Had it not been COVID-19, it would surely have been something else. The pandemic allowed even the most dysfunctional global governments and warring political tribes to coalesce around a common economic policy at a scale that will change how the world operates for decades.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      By requiring governments to borrow and spend previously unimaginable sums to offset the economic depressionary forces, the pandemic restored politicians to power. Central banks played their part, accommodating the unprecedented borrowing. But it is not central bankers who spend money. It is elected politicians. And after decades of increasing political dysfunction, a wide range of societal, infrastructure, environmental and geopolitical problems had grown to the point that nearly everyone recognized them as such, even as they may have disagreed about how to address them. The pandemic pushed our politicians back into action.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Unlike global bankers, who came to closely resemble one another as their policy frameworks coalesced around the Fed playbook, politicians are a varied species. How each approaches borrowing and spending can differ wildly even within a single country. The way they approach lists of long-neglected priorities naturally varies. What sectors will win and lose, what commodities will rise and fall, what taxes will come and go, regulations too, all such things are now in play. And nations differ. So, what had been a paradigm of unprecedented policy homogeneity, is in a year unrecognizable. Policy is now becoming increasingly heterogeneous.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Were this the only transition now underway in our always evolving world, it would mark the most important change that has occurred in half a century. It has already resulted in the world’s largest economy borrowing roughly 15% of GDP for two years running, with the Fed buying nearly all that debt. The subterranean forces that produced such a shock are manifold and have only just begun to surface. Into this cauldron comes something earthshaking that was conceived as a response to these same forces. It manifested in 2009 and is so utterly revolutionary as to be initially incomprehensible to almost everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Blockchain technology.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      In twelve short years, the blockchain ecosystem has grown to include 6,000+ protocols with a market capitalization over $2 trillion. Many are built to replace something incumbent institutions presently do; only faster, cheaper, and more securely. Some protocols are built to do things we previously considered impossible. Still others do things not previously imagined. Many pioneers have generated the kind of wealth only amassed in periods of great disruption, transition. They are not cashing out; they have only just started. They see a world very different from what has been. They have a revolutionary mindset, a broadening view of what is possible, and the wealth to bring their dreams to life. They are not afraid to fail. Many will of course. But not all. Their spirit is extraordinary, the ambition breathtaking.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The most revolutionary aspect of these technologies is that they allow for fully decentralized power. In their purest form, they are built to operate without central control. They allow the planet’s 7.9 billion people, connected through the cloud, to interact, exchange value, information, property rights, encrypted data, and do things we have only started to imagine, securely, without a centralized authority. Such change presents an existential threat to every organization operating with a centralized control model, which is nearly every single institution.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Some incumbents will attempt to co-opt these systems, harnessing their efficiencies, while distorting the protocols to achieve centralized control. Such is the vast power of these technologies that this path holds the potential to lead the world toward a dystopian future. Beijing appears to be pursuing this path, reflected in the implementation of its central bank digital currency. Perhaps the West will take a different path, one that reflects its values and the source of its strength, providing the space for a Cambrian explosion of these new private technologies. Allowing them to flourish - all within a sensible regulatory framework - bringing with them innovations and efficiencies that we are only beginning to glimpse. Such a path holds the potential to produce another Renaissance. Where this all ultimately leads is impossible to say.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      And this brings me to investment strategies for the decade ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The most important thing to internalize when constructing portfolios for the coming years is that we have entered the most uncertain period of our lifetimes. It is even possible we are at the dawn of the period of greatest change for the past few centuries. This is almost inconceivable, considering the bruising pace of transformation we are living through now. Our natural inclination, our human bias, is to deny this possibility. But as investors, it is our job to step outside ourselves and survey the landscape objectively. A fair accounting of the range of potential outcomes when looking out over the coming decade or two spans from dystopia to Renaissance. It would be unsurprising, with so much uncertainty, for sentiment to swing from expectations for one such extreme toward the other, multiple times.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Prices move over the longer-term to reflect fundamentals. The big moves happen because the future is materially different from the present. When that gap is not properly recognized and therefore not priced into today’s market, a large trend becomes inevitable. Of course, nothing is truly predetermined, and so sometimes price trends, once underway, can themselves distort the future. Such dynamics can either temper trends or amplify them reflexively. The latter can extend to such wild extremes that prices then reverse with equal force and severity.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Given the change ahead, and the reluctance of people to accept it, let alone recognize it, one should expect large moves in prices. Trends. Such an environment will reward the artistically minded, the venture investors, and those prepared to break with what is now seen, after decades of growing policy homogeneity, as investing orthodoxy. It should come as no surprise that at the outset of such an environment, investors in digital assets and the companies that are focused on these new technologies have produced extraordinary returns. That trend has only just begun.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      There will be enormous trends in other assets as well. Volatility markets will naturally present exceptional opportunities. Talented discretionary investors with unconstrained mandates, open minds and disciplined risk management should produce tremendous returns. An exceptional way to systematically capitalize on such an environment at scale is by deploying capital to trend-following strategies (CTAs). By removing the emotion and bias that handicap discretionary traders, and by spreading bets across many individual markets representing all the major asset classes, systematic trend-following strategies can profit in bull markets, bear markets. Renaissance. Dystopia. Extreme outcomes in either direction. The strategies are agnostic to the outcome, passionless, open minded, adaptable.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Systematic trend following has arguably just had its worst decade in the past century. The decade coincided with peak policy homogeneity, with central bankers expending extraordinary efforts to produce stability. Now trend strategies are generally shunned by investors, even as the world is transforming. Unsurprisingly, such strategies had their best decade of the last century in the tumultuous 1970s, producing tremendous returns in a period when inflation devastated most investment portfolios. After decades of low and stable prices, a return to a higher inflation regime appears not only likely, but it is a stated policy goal. None of this is to suggest we are headed for a repeat of the 1970s, or any other historical period for that matter. Systematic trend-following profits from great change, and it need not be a repeat of some previous regime.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      We are at a truly unique moment in human history, headed as always, into the unknown but with an unusually wide range of possible outcomes. This is a time of existential risk for those unwilling to adapt, and a time of extraordinary opportunity for those of us prepared to embrace quantum change. In periods of such profound transition, it is the case that the investment strategies that profited most handsomely in the old regime, suffer in the new. And as with all natural phenomena, those that struggled, have their day in the sun.

        <b>Anecdote (July 2014):</b> Charlie didn’t say a word. Nor did I. We just walked across the field. Together. He on my shoulders, riding high. And I imagined his beatific expression. I couldn’t see it, I felt it. I felt so many things. There are moments without which life would seem somehow unlived. Like when your child first opens his eyes and meets yours, for an infinite moment. Or when someone reaches for your hand, closes her eyes, and squeezes with the last atom of her fading strength. To say goodbye, forever. Now, Charlie is our youngest of four, and thus our weakest link. A wobbly little wildebeest. A straggler. On a busy street, or rushing through an airport, he learned to really slow his pace. Forcing me to swing him onto my shoulders. Which is pretty scary for a little fella. Exciting too. He’d grab my thinning mane in tight fists. Building confidence and trust; in himself, in me. Without which he couldn’t ever live a full life. Nor as his father, would I have truly lived mine. Charlie rode me like a polo pony. Turning my head left and right, kicking my ribs with sharp little heels. “Giddy Up!” We cut a historic deal a few years back: he’d lighten his grip on my hair if I’d tighten my grip on his ankles. Sounds like a bad deal, and no doubt it was far from my finest, but given our starting point, it was the best I could negotiate. And so it went. Anyhow, we walked across the field. “Shoulders please Daddy,” said Charlie. I swung him up. He grabbed my hair, I held his ankles. And it just felt time. So I lightened my grip, his hands slowly loosened theirs. I let go altogether. He did too. And on we walked. Without a word.

        <b>The Case for Digital Assets (January 3, 2021):</b>
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Human imagination is the most powerful force in the universe. It is the greatest single thing separating us from other creatures. There is no higher power. Our ability to conceive of a tomorrow that is better than today is a precondition for discovery, invention. And these two things quite naturally stack, compound. Their summation has lifted us from the Stone Age to the space station. The journey has only just begun. This should be obvious to everyone but the most hopeless pessimist.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Economically speaking, our ascent is defined by rising productivity, the spoils of which determine prosperity. In modern times, we have imagined various ways to distribute this wealth: socialism, communism, free-market capitalism. I can imagine other approaches - the Chinese are exploring one. But even within existing constructs, there are nuances. Today, capital owners collect a disproportionate share of profits relative to laborers. There is no intrinsic reason that this degree of inequality cannot persist. But in modern history it never has. And the societal stresses such inequality have produced are quite obviously manifesting, intensifying, metastasizing.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The private sector overwhelmingly sees itself as a more capable steward of research and development capital than governments. However, an examination of innovations traceable to state-funded initiatives during the past century suggests otherwise. I suspect the failure of Soviet communism led western free-market capitalists to imagine every element of our system to be superior. I imagine someday we will regard that black and white conclusion as foolish. China’s unprecedented economic rise and breathtaking technological advances should prompt Western self-reflection. So far it has not. I can imagine this being forced upon us. Perhaps abruptly.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      In fact, I can imagine many things. I can imagine almost everything, except of course, things that never cross my mind. Those are unknown unknowns, Black Swans. In my lifetime, not a single such creature has reversed human progress, let alone markets. Not for long anyway. Lehman was not a Black Swan. I worked there for seven years, and we spent most of them imagining the firm abruptly failing. Today’s pandemic is not a Black Swan either, it was a near certainty, arrival date unknown. Black Swans are generally magnificent, indistinguishable from magic - the internet, smartphones, cloud computing, quantum entanglement. The big risks are skewed to the upside, and manifest frequently. That is why we no longer live in caves. Yet periodically, our imaginations run wild with visions of cataclysms. I imagine that will never change.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      This leads me to investing. Which is principally about the identification of macro mega-trends. The two dominant trends of recent decades are now obvious: breathtaking technological advance and deepening global trade. The latter was not possible in the absence of the former. And the combined impact has left the world forever changed, connecting nearly eight billion people to one another in ways previously unimaginable, allowing the instantaneous exchange of information, ideas, and new forms of collaboration. But not only that, the advance gave each curious mind access to the collective discoveries and knowledge gained since the dawn of time.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Naturally there have been other trends. Population growth has been slowing, inexorably. In developed economies, societies started to age. First Japan, then Europe. China too. And these trends have interacted in complex ways to produce a disinflationary environment that naturally favored capital owners over laborers. Governments mostly ignored this growing imbalance and its corrosive social consequences. In fact, they implemented policies that amplified the problems, reversing each economic interruption with lower interest rates, greater debt, increased leverage, and this inflated asset prices, widening inequality.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      The process was reflexive in that each crisis required a more aggressive dose of the monetary stimulus that had itself contributed to the economic fragility in the first place. Such stimulus works by pulling demand from the future to the present and it therefore required no imagination to foresee that the process would ultimately deplete the former to sustain the latter. This end point was reached during the economic depression of early 2020. In response, western governments embarked on a new form of policy stimulus, issuing unprecedented quantities of bonds and then buying that debt with money created by their central banks.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      For students of economic history, such a familiar policy mix is implemented when governments intend to debase the currency in which they are borrowing. This allows them to simultaneously unburden themselves from the debt that they are incurring. It is a very rational late-cycle response to a difficult predicament. Throughout history, it has been attempted countless times. And I can imagine it going more smoothly this time, at least for a period. But as an investor who makes decisions on a probability adjusted basis, it is most certainly not the way to position a portfolio. Especially not with what is discounted in traditional asset prices.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      And this leads me to the case for digital assets.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Money is an illusion, perhaps the world’s greatest mass delusion. Out of desire and necessity, we succumb to the hypnosis. Without money, we are lost. And while we cling to its supposed permanence, a quick survey of history tells us money is anything but. Indeed, our central bankers have stated their intent to diminish its value via 2% inflation each year, in perpetuity. Between the global financial crisis and last year’s economic collapse, which is to say over twelve short years, they failed to achieve their stated goal of debasing the dollar at the desired pace. It was not through a lack of trying that they failed, but rather a misunderstanding of what money truly is.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Money is not real. It never has been. It never will be. It is our collective faith in the meaning of money that gives it value. Not even gold is real as a form of money. But for thousands of years, people have had collective faith in the useless yellow metal as a store of value, and at times, a medium of exchange. Naturally, something else equally useless could have served the purpose. But gold is scarce and for reasons we may never fully understand, we placed our collective faith in it. Even still, we unearth more each year. The pace of its extraction rises through time, increasing supply and thus debasing its value by 1%-2% per year, in perpetuity. As extraction technologies advance, that pace can quicken. We produced 2,470 metric tons of gold in 2005 and 3,300 metric tons in 2019. Within decades, we will surely extract gold from asteroids.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Bitcoin mysteriously appeared in 2009. A Black Swan. The technologies that in aggregate were combined to form the Bitcoin blockchain were not especially new or spectacular. But like all Black Swans, together they formed something revolutionary, the future. Some saw Bitcoin early and devoted their careers to it. Others punted around and profited. Some bought and held, becoming millionaires, billionaires. I saw it as so obviously the future of money that governments were unlikely to let it exist for long, lest they surrender their power of seigniorage. Instead, they would coopt whichever digital form of money became dominant and then destroy the private system that had developed it.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      There is no such thing as certainty, so there was always a possibility that Bitcoin and the digital assets that followed would be allowed to coexist in a world of digital dollars. Initially, that path appeared narrow. As the years passed, it has widened. The broadening adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with the innovative companies that are rapidly developing the blockchain ecosystem make it more difficult for governments to simply destroy these private systems. It is becoming easier to imagine a world where they are permitted to flourish alongside digital dollars, revolutionizing finance in ways that lay beyond the horizon. It is in our national interest to allow this. To embrace it, encourage it. And lead the world by example.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Nothing is without risk. And the risk to these assets is not simply that governments destroy them. It is possible that unknown flaws in their structure result in a failure that shakes faith in their value. Or that a massive theft raises sufficient alarm that investors abandon the asset class. Or it may even be that the ease with which new digital assets can be created will mean that we will fail to collectively concentrate faith in any single one, leaving many, each of little of value. I can imagine all these risks manifesting, although in every case, the risk is receding due to one of the most interesting features of digital assets. Reflexivity.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Most people still view digital assets as worthless. They are not wrong. In the aggregate, digital assets can be created just as easily as the Federal Reserve credits banks with digital dollars, which is to say that they can be created at no cost and in unlimited amounts. But imagine if one or two digital assets were to be selected as the object of our collective faith, just as gold and silver were once picked from the periodic table. And now imagine that unlike gold and silver, these digital assets are of finite supply and are the only such objects of that sort in a world of infinite fiat. It is not hard to imagine that such assets will become very valuable.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Bitcoin has no reference value. This makes it profoundly unique. No matter how its price rises or falls, the pace of production follows a preset path, halving every four years until 2140 when the last of the 21 million Bitcoins will be mined - for all eternity. When the price of gold rises abruptly, production increases. The same holds true for oil, copper, condos, equities, bonds, everything in an infinite universe. If the Bitcoin price rises 10x or 100x, production will not increase. Period. And this creates one of the more fascinating inversions in today’s inverted world: an asset that has finite supply, but no intrinsic value, could become priceless, if only we imagine it so.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      I can imagine how faith first formed in the value of gold. Its unique color, density and malleability allowed people to hold it and trust in its authenticity. True faith must be tested, repeatedly, tirelessly, mercilessly, and survive the assault every time. The great stories of antiquity, across all cultures, explore faith for a reason. It appears to be central to who we are. Elemental. Without it we are lost. Blockchain technology has introduced a way for humans to build faith in a new system that until recently was unimaginable. It is otherworldly, residing in the cloud, and becomes stronger, increasingly resilient, the more of us interact with it. As it becomes these things, it grows more valuable. And this then draws more people to it, reflexively.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      As people interact with such a novel system, it is natural that weaknesses are exposed. Their faith is shaken, some turn away. But others contribute ingenuity, investing in improvements; the means of storage become more secure, the code more robust, untrustworthy participants are removed, good money chases bad money out, use cases expand. As these forces interact in infinitely complex ways, our faith in the system rises, pushing digital asset prices beyond equilibrium. Sometimes wildly. This has happened to Bitcoin six times since it appeared. It has recovered from each boom/bust, growing stronger, more resilient. With every cycle, it has attracted more brilliant and ambitious entrepreneurs who see it as a technology platform that along with Ethereum will form the future of money, finance, and wonderful things we have yet to conceive.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      As people poured their energy into this new system, its promise extended far beyond a simple alternative to digital dollars. This has drawn new investors, innovators, and with each addition, it becomes more difficult for the government to destroy the system. Rather, the incentive to allow this new technology to coexist alongside digital dollars grows. As investors observe these trends emerge, they become more willing to invest, and as they do, it becomes harder still for the government to tear it down. The process is also reflexive. And this creates yet another great inversion in today’s inverted world: an asset that has no intrinsic value becomes increasingly safe to hold the more its price rises.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      This leads me back to investing, which is about considering risks versus rewards, assessing the probabilities of many possible outcomes, and the myriad paths to get there. But good investing also involves thoughtful portfolio construction. The longer-term trends and policy choices that led to today’s combination of highly valued risk assets and negatively yielding risk free assets, leaves today’s dominant portfolio construction highly exposed to a singular risk. Inflation. And in yet another inversion, investor portfolios are most exposed to the precise outcome that governments are aggressively trying to produce.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Today’s dominant portfolio consists of stocks and bonds. Bonds yield less than at any time in human history. Stocks are near the highest ever multiples. So, in a world where investors must achieve 7% annual returns to avoid insolvency, they leverage portfolios, amplifying gains, losses too. Unfortunately, at these yields, bond gains are unlikely to offset equity losses in a recession. During an inflationary period, bonds suffer, and history suggests this then causes equity losses. In a recession accompanied by inflation, portfolio losses are catastrophic. Most people cannot imagine that. But it is not as hard as you might think. An inflationary recession can happen when people lose faith in fiat.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Having spent over a decade failing to create inflation, governments recently embarked on a dramatic shift to overt monetary/fiscal coordination on an unprecedented scale. The pandemic provided the catalyst for politicians to temporarily support this new policy paradigm. But monetary/fiscal coordination on this scale is difficult to reverse. As discussed earlier, such coordination accompanies every monetary debasement. It would be unwise to bet this one will fail. Even if a new austerity sweeps our deeply divided government and causes another economic collapse, the call for more aggressive debasement will return immediately. In greater force.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      Faith is not something that is lost in a smooth line. It is gained slowly, arduously and lost abruptly. And so, it may be that policies now in place will appear appropriate, even prudent, for some time still. I can imagine that, just as easily as I can imagine the opposite. But it is hard to imagine the long-term trend of ever more aggressive policy stimulus failing to achieve its inflationary objectives now that governments are unconstrained by the fear of monetary/fiscal policy coordination. And what is attractive about the addition of digital assets to a portfolio is that they help mitigate this debasement risk without requiring you to pay negative carry while waiting.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      But digital assets not only help mitigate downside risks in a portfolio, they also provide exposure to the promise of humanity’s latest Black Swan, a new technology that has only just begun to reshape money. And that is the final inversion in today’s inverted world, because only in such a strange time can you make a highly convex, bullish bet on the promise of a brighter future that simultaneously protects you from suffering the severe consequences we face for our poorly managed past.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      And with each passing day, a rising number of the world’s smartest people contribute to the body of work that in aggregate enhances faith in these new digital systems. They do so without seeing one another, knowing one another’s name, location, or needing a common tongue. What they share is a common faith. And they cooperate in ways that a few short years ago were simply not possible. They improve upon the code that surrounds these assets. They build the architecture and interfaces that integrate these systems with the incumbent financial players, while simultaneously creating new products, features. And on top of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they build second layer applications that improve functionality, speed, efficiency, usability. This ensures that far into the future, digital asset innovations will continue to appear, making tomorrow look better than today.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      We all try to imagine how far something can rise, and how far it can fall. The latter is easy. Every digital asset can theoretically fall to zero, though it is terribly hard to imagine that they all will. It is much easier to imagine that in a world where fiat can be created without limit, and where the practical uses for these digital assets continually increase, their values can rise many, many times. Surely the value of Bitcoin can surpass that of gold. Owning these assets is a mere toehold to the future, a deposit on the view that everything we know about financial intermediation and its relationship to centralized policy will change in ways we cannot yet foresee. Holding these assets over the long-term aligns yourself with the macro mega-trends of technological advance and currency debasement, both of which appear to be accelerating. And naturally, where this all leads, and to what valuations, will be determined by our collective imagination.

      <b>Anecdote (Nov 2016):</b> “Nothing ever stays the same, ever,” he said. “All the people we’ve known over the years,” he said, squinting, looking back through time. “How many are still in the industry?” I considered the question. So many names, faces, personalities. Most gone. “You got to be adaptable. That’s my nature. I challenge the status quo. I’m a destroyer, a disrupter.” I looked around his office, abstract artwork, all different from my last visit. “When things are going great here, I rip them apart. And my people don’t understand. They’re stunned. They ask why?” But results speak for themselves, and he’s amassed one of the world’s great fortunes. “Our data shows that the alpha available in markets has declined over the past fifteen years.” The downward decline shows no signs of abating. A vast database of buy/sell decisions made by hundreds of our field’s best trading minds doesn’t lie. Wishing away this unfortunate fact won’t work. “We need to push our alpha capture back up. But it’s not possible by doing more of what we’ve always done.” You need to innovate. Do things differently. Think differently. “The law of economics is immutable. Excess profits are competed away. It’s not happening in our industry, it’s happened.” So he’s exploring artificial intelligence. Quantitative methodologies. Blending them with traditional approaches. And runs experiments, spreading capital across a range of innovative ideas, knowing that most will fail. But not all. “This game is over as we remember it, but there may be one more act. Maybe we can be the ones to shape it. And if it doesn’t work, at least we tried,” he said, smiling, with nothing left to prove to anyone but himself. “If I can’t outperform over 90% of everyone in the world, why even try? Who wants to be mediocre?”

      <b>Anecdote (Sept 2018):</b> “I’m fortunate to live in a time where the political system allows my kind of work,” said the Physicist. “Historically, it’s not always so.” Below us particles raced around CERN’s 27km subterranean track, held in precise formation, accelerating toward collision, obliteration, observation. We discussed magic, mysteries, the sublime wonder all around. “It’s incredible that we’ve been able to learn so much about nature, and that the language of mathematics turns out to be so effective in describing it,” he said. I smiled, having never quite considered that fact. “We’re now trying to produce a substance found throughout the universe that interacts with gravity but not light,” he explained. “But so far, no success.” The existence of Dark Matter was first hypothesized in the 1930s, we’ve searched ever since. It accounts for 95% of the Universe’s mass. The Physicist asked me about markets, intrigued by their movements, mechanics. There are parallels with quantum theory. Investor perceptions impact markets, which in turn changes investor perceptions in a reflexive loop that grows highly unpredictable in the extreme. The greatest opportunities in markets often reveal themselves first as mysterious phenomena. When markets move in opposition to general principles, it often means that something fundamental is changing. Reality is always changing. Our job as investors is to identify shifts early and adjust our frameworks accordingly. I asked the Physicist to explain the mystery that confounded Einstein and every physicist since: Quantum Entanglement. “I can understand the equations that describe it. But I’m intuitively mystified by the phenomenon,” he admitted. “In my field of work, I’m astonished often. And each time, I’m reminded that what we know about reality fits within perhaps 5% of all there is. And when you know so little about something so vast, it’s impossible to be certain whether what you believe you know is even reality.”

      <b>Anecdote (Summer 2012):</b> “I emptied my mind,” she explained, looking through me, returning to that mental place in the moment before her race began. I bit my lip to keep from smiling, even laughing. You see, she’s just 8yrs old, tiny for her age – seriously – like the 1th percentile. Yet Olivia’s coach has her swim against 11-year-olds. I don’t protest. Not my style. Plus, I’m pretty certain her coach quickly realized she has an inexplicably strong sense of self, loves to play up, and is uninterested in competing against peers; she just isn’t wired like most. Anyhow, Olivia took her lane one minute before the race began. Couple hundred spectators surrounded the pool. “Oh just look how teeny that girl is,” giggled the crowd. She cooly reached down, scooped handfuls of chilly pool water onto her skinny arms, toothpick legs, splashed her face. And focused intensely on her lane, as the older opponents observed Olivia’s unconventional ritual, amused, distracted. “Take your mark,” ordered the starter. “Pop,” and they leapt. For a 50-meter freestyle. Olivia hit the water last, like pretty much every race I’ve ever seen. And starting from last place she mounted her trademark challenge for 2nd to last, stalking the sick, the wounded. She finished a distant 6th. And having lost the race, but won many hearts, my little girl marched up to the Officials. Alone. Standing tall. Proud. On a natural high. “Excuse me, may I have my time?” she asked. You see, Olivia wants to win so badly it hurts. But she can’t yet. And knows it. So instead, she’s focused on her time, embracing it, improving it. Biding it. You know, odds are she’ll never be much of a swimmer, but someday, she’ll make a great trader.

      <b>Anecdote (Oct 2017):</b> “China’s financial system is a hermetically sealed snow globe,” he said. “They’ve built a system to resemble ours on the surface but scratch it and you discover something altogether foreign.” China has banks. They lend money. But pierce the patina and you find a vast subsidy machine, with no cold-blooded allocation of capital. There are no defaults to speak of, just bailouts, no reckonings. “The appearance of a modern financial system allows western financiers to pretend one exists. We are willing dupes in this charade.” Throughout history failing nations have turned to printing presses to arrest their decline. It has led to ruin. Always. But never has an emerging superpower used the printing press to turbo charge growth, dominate industries. The Chinese have reimagined the vast power of fiat. And they’re wielding it to build a 21st century nation atop the history’s greatest credit boom. The fate of this debt is uncertain, but the extraordinary infrastructure is not. “Ask any portfolio manager if they invest their personal wealth in Chinese debt? Not one will answer ‘Yes.’ But before long, we’ll all own Beijing’s bonds in our 401k.” The Chinese understand the agency problem in western asset management. We invest other people’s money, not our own. So they’re muscling their way into global indexes. Where passive flows will race to hit Chinese benchmarks, without anyone making a decision at all. We’re willing participants in our own demise. First, they exploited the west’s corporate fixation on short term profits, granting market access in exchange for local design/production, usurping our intellectual property. Next, they’ll exploit our financial system deficiencies to fund their unprecedented credit excess. “We continue to think of banking and finance though our own narrow lens. But the Chinese see an entirely different system. And they know that Rome was not built by bankers. It was built by force.”

      <b>Anecdote (Dec 2017):</b> “Let’s step into my office,” he said. So I did. He was my boss. “The firm’s most important client needs help.” I listened, uninterested, unconcerned about clients, their problems. Barely cared about my boss. I had a game to play, solo sport, and loved it to the exclusion of all else. “They need to do a very large trade,” explained my boss. A twenty-six-year-old proprietary trader’s mind is rather primitive. Which is good and bad. Being young and dumb allows you to see things elders can’t. And take risks one rarely should. In 1992, I’d done both. “They need to buy three hundred million Mark/Lira.” Europeans established a mechanism to lock their exchange rates into narrow ranges to reduce market volatility and promote economic convergence. In theory it worked, in practice it didn’t. Politicians named it the ERM. “What would you like to do?” he asked, calm. I stood there, processing. Such a sum was extraordinary even before the ERM blew up, which it just had. For months, I’d bought options in anticipation of its demise. Honestly, it was obvious. The ERM encouraged speculators to build massive leveraged carry positions, discouraged corporations from hedging exchange rate risk, suppressing volatility and interest rate spreads everywhere. The process was reflexive. Today’s central bank volatility suppression regime resembles it and will end in spectacular fashion. All such things do. “I want to buy more!” I answered. My foreign-exchange options left me long the exact amount our client needed to buy. No other bank would sell them such a large sum. So naturally, I wanted more. “You should sell them your whole position,” he told me, firm. I couldn’t understand, it made no sense. “Big customer orders like this usually mark the highs – never forget it,” he said. I left his office angry, irate, sold my whole position. And he was right.

      <b>Anecdote (Oct 2017):</b> “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure,” said the Englishman, stepping outside of himself. “That’s Goodhart’s Law.” Charles Goodhart observed that central banks measured money supply, and found certain M1 growth rates to be optimal. But once they targeted that optimal range, M1 lost its value as a measure. Market and economic actors adjusted their behavior to game the M1 system. So central bankers shifted to M2, then M3, and M4. “Investing is obviously not a science, but if it were, we would say that you can’t act on something and observe it at the same time.” French colonialists discovered this in rat infested Hanoi, when they offered a bounty for killing rodents. To receive the reward, the Vietnamese were required to produce severed tails. Soon thereafter, tail-less rats scurried throughout the city. The bounty hunters removed their tails and released them to the filthy sewers to breed. Boosting their bounty. “Investors discover pricing anomalies from the past. And they pile into them, ensuring that for a time they persist.” They mistake the distortions of their wall of money for the wisdom of their observations. They interact with the market as if they’re exogenous, when, in fact, they’ve become endogenous. “Today’s greatest example of Goodhart’s Law in action can be found in volatility markets.” The VIX index measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500, and is calculated by multiplying expected 30-day variance by 100. As a measure of market fear, it was quite useful, until it became something that could be traded. “The sheer size of outstanding positions in VIX futures, VIX options, ETFs, ETNs and bank volatility selling programs is such that those trading these markets can no longer separate the true measure of volatility from their own actions.”

      Zu Chongzhi was exposed to astronomy and mathematics as a child living in the Liu Song Dynasty. A time of turmoil, uncertainty, opportunity. The young man discovered he had a special thing for time, numbers, and devoted his remarkable life to their study. In 525AD he calculated that one earth year equaled 365.2428148 days, which is very close to our contemporary value of 365.2421988. He interpolated a calculation for the volume of a sphere, and calculated pi so accurately that his approximation became standard for 800yrs. To record the intermediate results of his endless calculations, Zu Chongzhi used a pile of wooden sticks, laid out in unique patterns. The pace of human progress has since accelerated. 2,519 years after Zu Chongzhi died, Google announced quantum supremacy, solving a mathematical problem in 200 seconds that would have taken the world’s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to execute. Just 2 years later, the Chinese named their quantum computer the ZuChongzhi. It just solved a problem 100-times more difficult than what Google tackled. China’s quantum computer has 66 qubits, but the team used only 56 for this experiment, which implies that its performance may be exponentially higher. So much work to stabilize such systems is still to be done. So it is. And in other news, Beijing tightened the screws on Didi and their big tech companies. Exerting their dominance over data, while signaling to the US that they will not be brought to bear for defending their interests. The Americans seemed distracted, withdrawing from a $1trln Afghan fiasco. Their financiers consumed by silly debates, like whether inflation is passing or permanent, while the deficit has soared 15% two years running, fully funded by the central bank. And their politicians fighting as always, actively eroding the very source of the nation’s strength – democracy.

      <b>Viva:</b> “Revolutions are defined by the revolutionaries,” said Marcel Kasumovich, our head of research. “History may find them after the fact, but we are living with them in real time. It started with Satoshi’s anonymity. This is part of the revolutionary design. Components of the Bitcoin protocol were invented long before Satoshi brought it together in a single, stable protocol. Adam Back created hash-cash that is the currency unit of the Bitcoin protocol. Satoshi is the Picasso, the creative genius, transforming buckets of paint into an enduring philosophy. Perhaps Satoshi understood there was no timetable for success. It could take days, years, or decades to inspire a generation. The anonymity of Satoshi allows the group to live forever. We are all Satoshi.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Viva II:</b> “It is not your average youth movement. It will not be defined by a noisy twitter debate or clever memes,” continued Marcel, placing this moment in historical context. “Vitalik Buterin was inspired by Satoshi, and the Ethereum protocol is going through its most profound transformation since its inception only a short six years ago. Would Satoshi have agreed with the Buterin fork? It is not the point. Splinters in the revolution are precisely part of the creative process; if you are not breaking things on the path to innovation, you are not doing it right. Then there is Stani Kulechov. A student of law in Helsinki Finland with an interest in programming who discovered the world of fintech through the lens of the Ethereum protocol and the smart contracts it could employ. ETHLend was created in 2017, and it is better known as the leading lending protocol of Aave.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Viva III:</b> “Aave is now the leader in decentralized finance. There is $10bln of locked capital in Aave protocols. Almost half of the $15bln in DeFi lending happens on the Aave protocol. Of the interest paid through DeFi lending, 46% is done through Aave at an annualized rate of $245mm. It is tempting to trivialize the achievement. After all, total loans and leases in the US commercial banking system are more than $10trln. But keep in mind Stani Kulechov achieved his graduate degree in law in 2018 and his interest in computer programming was cultivated as a teenager. The revolutionaries are not chasing any traditional financial institution. They are chasing a desire to make things better, and a hope for getting closer to the truth. In Kulechov’s words, “DeFi might not replace all TradFi service providers, but it will replace the software and infrastructure that TradFi is based upon”. With no hint of irony, he observes that “TradFi becomes the gateway for DeFi.””
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Viva IV:</b> “Regulation. It is the word to put shivers in the spine of any traditional institution evaluating asset allocation in the digital ecosystem. Regulation will not stand for it. Regulation will slow growth. Regulation will redistribute profit. Regulation will force decentralized agencies to be on a level playing field with centralized ones - as though traditional institutions are somehow disadvantaged from capital-starved decentralized players. It is a term used to invoke fear, and it requires far more precision in its mention. The crypto economy is regulated. Ask anybody in the money service business who is registered with FinCEN and provides thousands of monthly reports on suspicious transactions, by regulatory decree. As the crypto economy enters the mainstream, it will blend with TradFi as a matter of practicality. It must and it will.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Viva V:</b> “Regulation is the gateway for DeFi to enter the mainstream, and it is already happening. Last August, Aave received an Electronic Money Institution license from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, that allowed the protocol to trial services with UK citizens. Aave Pro will be released in this month, aimed at bringing institutions into the liquidity pool of decentralizing lending. Well-regarded smart contracts will add centralized tools such as whitelisting of addresses and know-your-customer provisions. These are precisely the steps that the FATF regulatory body would desire.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Viva IV:</b> “There is no turning back,” explained Marcel. “The technology is being tested, adopted, and admired. The revolution is happening from within institutions with leaders who see a better way. It will take time for users to see the value. After all, statues of revolutionaries are only mounted long after their work is done. But make no mistake – the people and firms who underestimate the intelligence, drive and creativity of those working on change are precisely the ones who will be, at best, left behind and, at worst, run-over by the technologies. These are not our parents’ revolutionaries.”

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Anecdote:</b> Each generation believes it can create a better world. Were it not so, we would still live in caves. Some generations thirst for change through revolution. That probably has to do with longer term economic and political cycles. But for whatever reason, amongst these revolutionary generations, some are more determined, effective. The 1960s-70s youth seemed radical, but they were far from French revolutionaries. Their actions failed to spark an inferno. My wife Mara grew up in a hippy enclave during that period. Her town sought to opt out of the system by going backward, living off the land, returning to simpler times. But history rarely turns back the clock for long. That generation never had a credible plan to replace the system with something better. Nor did it have a new technology to amplify force. The establishment knew this. The youth back then presented no real threat, just the appearance of instability. Daisies and LSD. But today’s youth have built the technologies to power revolution. Their protocols remain nascent, but if they’re allowed to flourish (or if they cannot be stopped), they will credibly replace incumbent industries that the masses have come to despise (retail banks, commercial banks, central banks, wall street, money transfer agents, credit card companies, social media companies, exchanges of every kind, censors, and the list has just started). Someday these technologies may threaten our notion of centralized government control. In the 1960s-70s, incumbents knew the revolutionaries had no credible plan. This time, revolutionary technologies are already being rolled out. They are more efficient, cheaper, faster. They cut out the middlemen. And empower the individual. Today’s incumbents are threatened with extinction. In fact, if today’s business leaders were 30yrs younger, most would be racing to build their companies/wealth in this new field of blockchain. This is what a credible revolution looks like, waged by brilliant youth, impassioned, with fantastic ideas, immense wealth, and humanity’s most powerful technologies, applied in ways that incumbents can barely understand. And it is too early to tell exactly where this new generation will lead us, only that it is to a profoundly different future.

      <b>Anecdote (Feb 2017):</b> “You either have risk on, or you do not,” said Simplicity, walking Occam’s Razor, “There are only these two states, nothing more.” He lifted both hands, palms up, to illustrate the point. “Now, reflect on the levels of anxiety you have experienced in each state throughout your career.” And decades of an agitated existence flashed before my eyes. “There are times when you are carrying an enormous amount of risk and sleep like a newborn. And there are times when you have a tiny amount of risk yet feel deeply perturbed.” Sometimes you carry no risk and feel supremely relaxed. “But the most interesting state is the one where you have no risk and experience intense anxiety.” There are only a few times in a year to make a lot of money. When those times occur, you need to be involved, aggressive, big. The rest of the year it is best to do as little as possible. “How do you tell the few opportune times from all the others?” asked Simplicity, weighing imaginary scenarios in each hand, “The answer is: you just do.” And I smiled, because of course, that is at once the simplest and most complex answer in all the world. “I was wrong about the election result,” he explained. “And I was then wrong about the reaction to the election.” He bought gold when Florida looked likely to fall. It rallied, then reversed unexpectedly. “I knew enough to immediately get out of all of my risk, everything.” Leaving him to observe the world with clear eyes. “For two days I watched, as a growing anxiety consumed me. I had no risk on at all but wanted to jump off a bridge.” And Simplicity paused, reflecting. “There are times when you just know that something important is happening. And that you must take risk.”

      date: "June 27, 2021",

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      “In 18 incidents, described in 21 reports, observers reported unusual Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) movement patterns or flight characteristics,” wrote the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). “Some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernible means of propulsion. In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency energy associated with UAP sightings.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Overall:</b> “Sociocultural stigmas and sensor limitations remain obstacles to collecting data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP),” wrote the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “Narratives from aviators in the operational community and analysts from the military and Intelligence Community describe disparagement associated with observing UAP, reporting it, or attempting to discuss it with colleagues.” Nothing new there. Throughout human history, those comfortable in the consensus have shown utter contempt for the lonely voices who threaten to upend the prevailing worldview. And yet, without those courageous enough to speak their truth, we would live in a perpetual Dark Ages. Such is the depth of our fear of change that we persecute the brave few, even as they drag us into a better future, kicking, screaming. It is too early to know whether these UAP represent anomalies of earthly origin, or an extraterrestrial intelligence. But for some mysterious reason, we appear finally prepared to consider the latter. How we react to news is often more interesting than the events themselves. Contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence would simultaneously represent the greatest risk and opportunity in human history – far surpassing the arrival of Columbus in the Americas. So why are we seemingly unperturbed by today’s possibility? Perhaps collapsing faith in institutions leaves us distrustful of anything we are now told. Maybe, our growing acceptance of ever wilder conspiracy theories has numbed us to anything, everything. Or possibly, we are already processing such profound change in politics and policy - which produced successive years of 15% US federal deficits, fully funded by the central bank, even as inflation soars and we expand infrastructure spending - that we have no remaining mental space for another alien. But no matter, back here in our earthly existence, it is a reminder to us traders and investors that no matter how momentous the change, it only matters for markets when for some mysterious reason it starts to matter.

      <b>Back and Forth:</b> In a week when the US military released its report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, it is awfully hard to find the energy to write (or read) any more about today’s fiscal/monetary singularity. So I’ll keep the boring crap short: Two weeks ago, the Fed surprised markets by pulling forward its plans to escape today’s inflationary policy vortex by a quarter or two. Over-leveraged traders puked. This past week, markets more or less realized there is no escaping such a strong gravitational policy pull. This back and forth will be with us for years.

      <b>Interesting Others:</b> “We currently lack data to indicate any Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) are part of a foreign collection program or indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary,” wrote the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “The UAP documented in this limited dataset demonstrate an array of aerial behaviors, reinforcing the possibility there are multiple types of UAP requiring different explanations. Our analysis of the data supports the construct that if and when individual UAP incidents are resolved they will fall into one of five potential explanatory categories:
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>1. Airborne Clutter:</b> These objects include birds, balloons, recreational unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or airborne debris like plastic bags that muddle a scene and affect an operator’s ability to identify true targets, such as enemy aircraft.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>2. Natural Atmospheric Phenomena:</b> Natural atmospheric phenomena includes ice crystals, moisture, and thermal fluctuations that may register on some infrared and radar systems.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>3. US Gov’t or Industry Developmental Programs:</b> Some UAP observations could be attributable to developments and classified programs by U.S. entities. We were unable to confirm, however, that these systems accounted for any of the UAP reports we collected.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>4. Foreign Adversary Systems:</b> Some UAP may be technologies deployed by China, Russia, another nation, or a non-governmental entity. [Is it me or did they just label China an adversary?]
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>5. Other:</b> Although most of the UAP described in our dataset probably remain unidentified due to limited data or challenges to collection processing or analysis, we may require additional scientific knowledge to successfully collect on, analyze and characterize some of them. We would group such objects in this category pending scientific advances that allowed us to better understand them. The Department of Defense Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) intends to focus additional analysis on the small number of cases where a UAP appeared to display unusual flight characteristics or signature management.”

      <b>First Encounter:</b> “The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound,” wrote Liu Cixin in his brilliant sci-fi novel, The Three Body Problem, exploring the complex risks and rewards of first contact with alien intelligence. “Even breathing is done with care. The hunter must be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds another life - another hunter, angel, or a demon, a delicate infant to tottering old man, a fairy or demigod - there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>First Encounter II:</b> “The inhabitants are all unprovided with any sort of iron, and they are destitute of arms, which are entirely unknown to them, and for which they are not adapted; not on account of any bodily deformity, for they are well made, but because they are timid and full of terror,” wrote Christopher Columbus in 1492. “But when they see they are safe, and all fear is banished, they are very guileless and honest, and very liberal of all they have. No one refuses the asker anything that he possesses; on the contrary they themselves invite us to ask for it. They manifest the greatest affection towards all of us, exchanging valuable things for trifles, content with the very least thing or nothing at all.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>First Encounter III:</b> “Thus it pleased God to vanquish their enemies and give them deliverance,” wrote William Bradford in 1630, his first-hand account of an early battle, having arrived on the Mayflower. “And by His special providence so to dispose that not any one of them was either hurt or hit, though their arrows came close by them and on every side of them; and sundry of their coats, which hung up in the barricade, were shot through and through. Afterwards they gave God solemn thanks and praise for their deliverance and gathered up a bundle of their arrows and sent them into England afterward by the master of the ship and called that place the First Encounter.”

      <b>Anecdote:</b> “Reality is I was not put into any leadership positions,” said Jackson, “That’s not what being a plebe is about.” Mara and I dropped off our oldest at the Annapolis gates last July in a N95 mask, with $100 and a small backpack. We just picked him up an inch taller, thirty pounds of new muscle, our car filled with naval uniforms and lacrosse gear. “To learn to lead, you need to first learn to follow,” explained Jackson. “That’s what being a plebe is all about. And as the year progresses, you encounter different styles as your superiors are trying to learn to lead, sometimes well, and other times terribly.” Two years ago, Jackson faced his first consequential choice. He could attend a liberal arts university, a business school, or a service academy. He chose my alma mater, a liberal arts path. But as the months passed, that choice felt wrong for some reason. So he changed course, re-committed to Navy, an institution dedicated to teaching the art of leadership. Each year, 1,200 kids enter the academy, 91% varsity athletes, 73% captains of their high school teams. Alphas. Those who graduate, typically lead 12-50 enlisted personnel as their first naval assignment. “The people who were hypocrites in even a small way struggled to command respect. I always knew that, but we really got to see it happen this year. And our superiors who got nervous and felt out of control, when they imposed punishments that were so extreme that they were impossible to be practically enforced, their credibility slowly eroded, then collapsed,” he said, explaining that these mistakes inevitably helped those who made them course-correct and become better leaders. “The ones who commanded the respect of people above and below them were those who knew the rules well but could distinguish between the letter of the law and the spirit. They knew when to be very hard on us but had the awareness and confidence to make exceptions based on the circumstances. They were the ones we most admired. Those were the leaders.”

        “A nation’s exchange change rate is the single most important price in its economy; it will influence the entire range of individual prices, imports and exports, and even the level of economic activity. So it is hard for any government to ignore large swings in its exchange rate,” said Paul Volcker, Federal Reserve Chairman from 1979-1987.

        <b>Overall:</b> “It was meant to be a tool providing dovish forward guidance,” explained Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, fluttering his feathers. “It ended up being a tool that provided hawkish forward guidance - I continue to think we ought to just kill the dot plot,” cooed the dove. The system was introduced in 2012 with interest rates stuck at 0%. It provided the Fed with a new monetary tool as it was becoming evident the old ones were no longer working. The ‘dot plot’ allows each Fed President and Governor to communicate where they think the federal funds rate should be at the end of future calendar years. As of Wednesday afternoon, 7 of 18 Fed Presidents and Governors thought rates would be lifted above 0% by the end of 2022, and 13 of 18 thought rates should be lifted by the end of 2023. In any nation on earth, at any time in human history, such a collection of dots would have been seen as wildly dovish given the robust economic growth, record asset prices, and explosive moves in inflation seen throughout today’s economy. And that is before considering this same Fed committed to continue buying $120bln of Treasury and mortgage bonds each month with money they create with their computers. But of course, there are no absolutes in monetary matters, only relativity, and this week’s dot plot indicated the Fed consensus is a little less dovish now than it was in March. Such is the precarious state of our markets that a modest shift in what the Fed thinks it may do in 18-30 months moved prices at all. 2yr yields rose 11bps to 0.26%, 10yr yields fell 1bp to 1.44%, 5yr/5yr inflation swaps fell 8bps to 2.29%, the S&P 500 fell 1.9%. The dollar jumped, gold dumped, commodities too, as the inflation trade suffered a setback, its first of many in this emerging cycle. Because naturally, that’s how markets move.

        <b>Fed:</b> The fed funds rate was 9.75% when I arrived in the pit, Chicago 1989. US GDP that year was 3.7%, unemployment 5.4%, and inflation 4.6%. But the S&L crisis was widening, as they do. So the Fed cut rates 75bps. Back then, the Fed certainly didn’t signal its intentions. In fact, the Fed neither confirmed nor denied what changes it made to interest rates even after it made them. Unimaginable, right? So we had to guess Fed policy changes by observing what happened in money markets. I obviously didn’t understand any of it, after all, I was an economics major.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Fed II:</b> The S&P 500 loved that 75bp rate cut more than it feared the S&L crisis, so stocks took out the 1987 peak, making new highs in the autumn of ’89. There was still tons of brain damage from ’87, and traders are notorious for being superstitious, so the pit was nervy that October. When the S&P plunged -6% out of the blue on October 13th, the trading pit went utterly berserk. I was so happy in that market mayhem. Soon enough, the Fed cut rates another 75bps. The S&P 500 grinded back up through the end of my first year, but never made new highs.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Fed III:</b> Despite the 150bps of rate cuts in 1989, and the record S&P highs, the economy soon entered a recession. The Fed kept cutting rates for a couple years, ending at an impossibly low rate of 3.00% in Feb 1992. US GDP was 3.5%, unemployment 7.4% and inflation was 2.9%. I had made my way to London that year as a prop trader, just in time for the Exchange Rate Mechanism collapse. The Europeans had created a system to ensure stability, certainty. And this naturally encouraged traders and investors to build massive leveraged investment positions.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
       <b>Fed IV:</b> When systems designed to ensure stability fail, which they inevitably do when applied to things as unstable as economies, the consequences are profound. As Europe worked through its ERM collapse, Greenspan held fed funds at 3.00% for what seemed an eternity. No one could understand anything he ever said, so you can’t blame him for promising certainty, stability. But people see what they want to see, hear what they want to hear, believe what they want to believe. And soon, folks discovered how to make money by betting rates would never change, much as they had bet on stability and certainty ahead of the ERM collapse.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Fed V:</b> US GDP in 1994 was 4.0%, unemployment was 5.5% and inflation 2.7%. Greenspan hiked rates 25bps to 3.25% in Feb 1994. Employment gains had been on a tear, and yet, somehow no one expected that rate hike. Naturally, he hadn’t pre-signaled a change. The bond market collapsed. Most people don’t think bond markets can crash, but that’s only because they haven’t traded long enough to live through one. Like all crashes, that one happened for all sorts of complex reasons, but the biggest was that the system was highly leveraged to a certain future.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Fed VI:</b> Each interest rate cycle has been different of course. Over the decades, the Fed became increasingly transparent. That transformation was surely well-intended, seeking to reduce the risk of creating crises like that ’94 crash. But it is impossible to create certainty without also increasing fragility - that’s how markets work. As the system became more fragile, it required increasingly aggressive Fed intervention with each downturn. The process has been reflexive. Now markets move based on what policy changes the Fed says it may make in 18-30 months.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Anecdote:</b> Congress mandated that the Federal Reserve promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. That was in 1978. Unsurprisingly, the nation was reeling from years of high unemployment, rapidly inflating prices, and soaring long-term interest rates. In the decades since, the Fed has done a remarkably good job at meeting their specific mandate. But like all systems built to create certainty, stability, it has simultaneously produced profound fragility. This is most clearly seen in the need for ever more dramatic monetary interventions with each cyclical downturn. Less obvious is the rising political fragility which is increasingly destabilizing the nation. Having tasked the Fed with producing economic prosperity by any monetary means necessary, our politicians then stepped away. They stopped governing effectively, fanned the flames of animosity, shielded from the adverse economic consequences of their dereliction of duty. In each economic crisis, it was the Fed that provided leadership, forestalling collapse, but at a compounding cost. Now the nation approaches a point of peak economic and political fragility. And while it is easy to condemn the Fed for having enabled the decades of dysfunction, it is the political system that must bear the blame. But no matter, the Fed must soldier on, like a magnificent machine, attempting the impossible, delivering certainty without fragility, spinning ever faster to stand still. And the greatest risk it now faces in meeting its mandate is an economic crisis accompanied by inflation. Such a crisis would force it to choose between a return to orthodox policy and the consequent defaults that would devastate asset prices, or a currency collapse and runaway inflation that rebalances the value of our assets and liabilities. Without a determined improvement in our politics, it is increasingly likely that we must endure the latter, followed by the former. And this drama will surely play out in the decade ahead.

        In early 2000, the Nasdaq soaring, American businessman Dennis Tito planned a trip to space. He paid $20mm to spend 8-days on the International Space Station (ISS), and then watched the 2001 bust from orbit. He was the first private citizen to leave earth. In 2008, Richard Garriott paid $30mm for 12-days on the ISS. On his 3rd day in orbit, he watched Lehman declare bankruptcy far below. On July 20th, Blue Origin will head to space with Bezos and his brother on board. Jeff just auctioned off a seat for the brief sub-orbital ride. The anonymous buyer is unlikely a value investor, having paid $28mm for the 11-minute roundtrip. Then in Jan 2022, three private citizens will pay $55mm each to ride a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for an 8-day visit. What kind of market will they see below?

        <b>Overall:</b> “What the hell,” whispered the bewildered bureaucrat, pulling out his protractor. The CPI report had surprised again to the upside; headline, core, the components. “How’d this thing get away from us?” asked his colleague, heart racing. Following decades of oscillating in a tight range, the trajectory of consumer prices went parabolic. But of course, everyone at the agency with a command of calculus left ages ago for more interesting endeavors. Those left behind were more comfortable with algebra, geometry. And secure in a linear world, they sought to produce flat lines for a living. In the late-1990s they introduced ‘hedonics’ at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The term is derived from the Greeks, well known for hedonism and hyper-inflation. Applying the technique to a good or service that had improved in quality and/or functionality allowed the bureaucrats to magically turn price inflation to deflation. In this way, anything whose price increased at a pace that lagged the increase in pleasure it produced, would be seen to have grown cheaper. Hedonically speaking that is. And this was not the only innovation. BLS bureaucrats substituted hamburgers for hotdogs when the former’s price jumped faster than the latter. And vice versa. Such an innovation could be applied to almost anything. And since 1983 they used an alchemical equation called Owner’s Equivalent Rent (OER) to turn rapid housing price inflation to something more stable. Flattish. Linear. With so many wonderful tools to temper each price blip, reported inflation barely budged even as the cost of living rose inexorably for the 332,418,508 Americans who don’t work at the BLS. “Alright ladies and gentlemen, back to work, let’s flatline this baby, and bring things under control,” ordered the big boss, irritated to have been temporarily outsmarted by the latest Fed and Treasury monetary machinations, “A nickel to the first one of you who can figure out how to turn Bezos’s $28mm Blue Origin trip into a $25 hedonic roller coaster ride!”

        <b>Drinking Games:</b> “The extraordinary thing about what we’re living through is that the number of amplification circuits in the market, in psychology, and in the economy for inflation being brought forward is unlike anything ever seen,” said the CIO, high atop his prodigious pile. “We all know about supply chain issues. But it is so much more than that,” he said. “To think about rebuilding inventories just to a normal level, it is helpful to think about the MIT Beer Game, where even a small move in ordering patterns creates a big move in demand.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Drinking Games II:</b> “Not only are we trying to bring inventories back in line with demand, but we’re also learning it’s better to have some just-in-case inventory,” continued the same CIO. “And we’re all hearing about inflation so it’s better to have a bit more inventory. Plus there are so many reported shortages that we see hoarding behaviors. Bringing forward the level of working capital to satisfy demand is going to be here for more than a couple months.” Economists expect supply and demand to return to rough balance by September. “The pull-through of demand will take us into 2022.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Drinking Games III:</b> “Consumer demand numbers will come down. But the inventory build is still needed and given the scaring and hoarding and inflationary psychology behind it, it is going to last longer,” he explained. “Then there’s the financial market effects. Investors think inflation is coming, so the 60:40 portfolio is broken. But how do they protect against it? They buy commodities, invest in trend. It means financial demand in commodity markets extends the trends that amplify the dynamic. We bring inflation forward through financial demand for protection from inflation.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Drinking Games IV:</b> “The monetary/fiscal regime shift implies that fiscal policy is the impulse that matters most for demand,” he said. “It is the tool that’s being applied through the lens of the virus, which provides the excuse that we have to deploy fiscal at scale,” he added. “So when the virus is no longer an issue, and we attempt austerity, it will be when all the other amplifying forces also act in reverse. This will create tremendous volatility, But for the moment, policy, financial markets and financial processes are all amplifying the inflationary impact.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Drinking Games V:</b> “What happens to unit labor costs as we go through this year?” he asked. “The standard response is we can’t find enough workers and so once we pull benefits, there will be more labor, reducing upward wage pressure. But there is a path dependency to it. The effect of supply not coming back now is that the number of people quitting their jobs to find other jobs at higher wages is rising. The velocity of labor is increasing. So, we’re pricing a large part of the labor market to the marginal price of labor, which is going up now. Where does that leave us if the inflationary narrative is still here in Q4? We may find that unit labor inflation is stickier than conventional output gap analysis would suggest.”
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Drinking Games VI:</b> “We may well see that the fireworks of soaring ticket prices, TV prices, and used car prices, give way to underlying sticky phenomena that are associated with a more sustained inflation,” he said. “And the Fed will still say that inflation expectations are not becoming unanchored. Then at some point, the market will test it. We’ll get the reverse of these inflationary feedback forces. It will all work the other way for a time. Amplifying everything in the reverse direction. The 60:40 portfolio will work again for a time. We’ll get downside inflation. That will be the end of the first phase of the great inflation. It will be short lived, and we will then resume the upward path in prices. Driven by rising debts, and a series of rolling currency crises.” 
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Anecdote:</b> “Feels like we’re at a historic crossroads,” said the CIO, an early venture investor in digital assets and the blockchain entrepreneurs who engineer them. “The rise of China, their deliberate advance, their vision for humanity, their disregard for human rights,” he continued. “And here, the inequality, growing division, political conflict, social clashes. We struggle to find common ground on even the most basic issues, facts.” The policy experiment now underway throughout the west would be unnecessary had we managed our affairs with wisdom, vision, discipline, integrity. “I read research from the greatest macro thinkers drawing parallels between today’s reality and the 1930s, the early 70s. The decline of Rome, the fall of empires, reserve currencies. And when I see the dysfunction of our political system, archaic regulatory frameworks that drive innovation abroad, at some intuitive level I know these risks are real,” he said. “But nothing is inevitable. And we have this technological revolution unfolding. Accelerating. I’m immersed in it all day, every day. The most creative, stunningly brilliant engineers in the world are building projects that have the potential to revolutionize virtually everything we do, and things we have only begun to imagine.” He started his journey in 2012, attending west coast bitcoin gatherings, meeting the beautiful young minds. Vitalik Buterin. Charles Hoskinson. So many others. Each boom in digital asset prices attracted more hungry, curious risk takers. Each bust shed the weak. The tenacity of those unwilling to quit created an antifragile ecosystem, unlike the legacy institutions that they sought to reinvent in ways that will create a more transparent, efficient, inclusive and just economy, society. Now he runs one of the leading early-stage digital funds. Identifying entrepreneurs, connecting them, producing extraordinary returns. “I feel that if we have the courage to embrace this change, as a society, we will experience another Renaissance. The potential is that consequential. But I just don’t know whether we have that in us anymore as a nation. And I worry that at this moment of incredible promise, we fail out of fear. Feels like the outcome is binary.”

      “Drift. Apathy. Distrust,” barked Biggie Too, feeling it, already in a groove. “Frustration. Irritation. Uneasy anticipation,” continued the chief global strategist for one of Wall Street’s Too-Big-To-Fail affairs. “Biggie got this deep dark feeling he’s way too early,” whispered Too, lips pursed, right at home in 3rd person. “We lost our faith in politicians and the media. Institutions. Now we’re losing trust in science, our scientists, Biggie sees them cracks spreading,” said Biggie, pointing to his bank of screens, Fauci getting Fox’d. “And yet, through it all we still have absolute trust in the Fed,” said Biggie, squinting. “Guess this thing goes and goes until our central bankers get humiliated too. When we discover inflation ain’t transitory.”

      <b>Overall:</b> “Our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business,” wrote AMC’s management to the SEC, seeking approval to issue more shares, of which he controls an unlimited supply. The meme stock had jumped nearly 100% in a single day, extending gains this year to +2,850%. At nearly 8-times its pre-pandemic high, AMC’s price has diverged far from reality if there is even such a thing. Oil prices jumped yet again, extending this year’s rally to over 40%. OPEC responded by increasing output, over which it has an outsized influence, trying to roughly match supply to our reopening reality. Unlike equity, which can be created as easily as fiat currency in infinite quantities at the click of a mouse, the production of commodities is a far more difficult affair. Capital intensive. With varying lead and lag times that reflect real world realities. And this makes their prices especially sensitive to both the quantity and velocity of fiat. Now into our second year of 15% federal deficits, funded for free by newly created dollars, those things which are hardest to produce are generally rising faster than others. So far this year, consumer prices have leapt at a +6.2% annualized pace. With the Federal Reserve able to buy as many bonds as needed to hold 2-year yields at 0.15%, a level wildly disconnected from reality, real interest rates are now deeply negative. National housing prices are rising at the fastest pace in recorded history: +20% from this time last year, with sales surging +35%. Over that one-year span, the S&P 500 has risen +40%. In 2021, it is rising at a +30% annualized pace (+12.6% year-to-date). Such is the magic of money illusion. And this, of course, is the unstated aim of the latest stage in our experiment. But its success relies on wages outpacing these various metrics, if the system is to trend back toward equilibrium. But year to date, average hourly earnings have risen at a +3.4% annualized pace.

      <b>Beijing:</b> “The philosophical tug-of-war between the US and China has usual extension into policy,” said Marcel, our head of research. “While the Western word charts a path of new orthodoxy, China is sticking to a more conventional, conservative approach. The decline in the US dollar has extended to China, with bond investors racing to the yield enhancement within the currency hedge. China’s bond market is one of the few that is entirely uncorrelated with broader market – virtually no correlation to US equities or US bonds. This is the type of diversification that bond investors crave in a yield-starved world.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Beijing II:</b> “Long gone are the days of China fretting about a stronger currency for fears of choking off the economy,” continued Marcel. “Yes, China activity is slowing through weaker global trade. The latest surveys of business conditions show that expectations for activity are very strong in both goods and services. But current trade activity is weakening sharply with exports in both goods and services contracting. Trade accounted for less than 4% of China’s growth in the past seven years. Softness in trade is a sign of things to come in global activity. China’s focus on the exchange rate is more about financial stability than economic outcomes – the recent slowdown was China’s aim, not an accident.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Beijing III:</b> “Policy sent a market signal last week, raising reserve requirements for holding foreign exchange to 7% from 5%. This will start on June 15, and it’s the first hike in more than a decade. China is fretting more about the return of carry trades that led to unruly conditions in shadow banking as local investors resorted to financial engineering to elevate returns. This is a pre-emptive strike, a reminder to the banking system that policy isn’t asleep at the switch. There has been a sharp rise in USD dollar holdings of banks and the rise in reserve requirements is reducing liquidity available for various long-CNY trading exposures. It is a common policy signal.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Beijing IV:</b> “We also see signals in China’s fixing rate against the US dollar. At the same time policy was tightening US dollar liquidity, the official exchange rate was set weaker than market expectations. This, too, is a signal, a reminder to the banks that policy won’t sit idle and accommodate excess speculation towards a stronger CNY. The judgment was that US dollar inflows into the banking system were there to create Chinese renminbi longs in the future. US policy is pushing for a dollar depreciation. China’s may be more hands-off on intervention, but the latest actions are a reminder this is a trend that they intend to manage.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Beijing V:</b> “The contrast to the US is stark. The excess liquidity of US dollars is everywhere. Front-end US dollar yields across the world have converged to ultra-low levels. China 2-year paper swaps back to US dollars at zero percent. If you want China’s higher yield, you must take the currency risk. Even Brazil, with high debt and rising political risks like those seen in Peru and Chile, can borrow US dollars for 2-years at less than 50 basis points. Where do the dollars go when there is nowhere else to go? Back to the Fed. The reverse repurchase agreement – a liability to the Fed – surged to $479 billion and is set to rise further. All at a 0% interest rate.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
      <b>Beijing VI:</b> “And so goes the irony. In a world where businesses are screaming about shortages of labor and inputs to production, the surplus of US dollars in the system runs the risk of the Fed losing control of the Federal fund rates…to the downside.”

      <b>New Ideas Party:</b> “Next week I will send to congress a bill that will make bitcoin a legal tender,” announced El Salvador’s President Bukele. There are 195 countries on the planet. El Salvador ranks 103rd in GDP. 20% comes from remittances, most of which cost recipients 10% in fees. About 1/3 of the nation lives below the poverty line. 70% have neither a bank account nor credit card. El Salvador leads in nothing really. But the President and his New Ideas Party just made it the first nation on earth to accept bitcoin as legal tender. It won’t be the last.

      <b>Anecdote:</b> “Augmented/Virtual reality (AR/VR) is being adopted at six-times the pace that was expected one year ago,” said the scientist. “The content is good enough, the technology fast enough and the price sufficiently low for adoption curves to start turning up hard,” he continued from the valley. “This is the next platform, merging reality and fantasy into something altogether new.” Big tech is racing to develop technologies to project images from eyeglasses directly onto our retinas, advancing the integration that started decades ago with the advent of the desktop and its connection to the internet. “The images can be fun. Pokemon. Dinosaurs. Rockets. And they can be educational, allowing us to explore a 3D image of the human heart. Or commercial, projecting an image of that new Crate & Barrel couch into our actual living room before we buy it with crypto all within this AR environment. It will be indistinguishable from reality,” he said. “The technologies will allow us to reach out and interact with the space around us. Touching things we see, that don’t actually exist. And as technology improves it will allow us to interact with other people in an increasingly virtual world. You and I will have this conversation and I’ll grab a virtual globe, spin it, and choose a place we’ve never visited. We’ll both go there and explore together,” said the scientist, growing increasingly excited, speaking faster. “But because we’re both wearing glasses, and are 3,000 miles apart, we will not be able to see one another’s physical bodies. So instead we will have avatars, which are already common. But they’ll become increasingly realistic, and we’ll grow accustomed to recognizing one another’s avatars. It will feel more and more natural. Perhaps, someday, more natural than seeing one another in person. And we’ll inevitably have different avatars we use when spending time with different people. Each one, reflecting aspects of who we are, or want to be,” he said. “And this is all happening. It’s not a maybe. It’s a matter of time, and it’s coming fast. We are racing toward a new form of human reality.”

      <b>Anecdote (Aug 2011):</b> “Never hire a Harvard Business School grad until they fail at least once,” he advised me. You see, he taught there. Filled his life with books, movies. Jewish intellectual, author, psychiatrist to rock-stars, advisor to top CEOs. Atheist. And you know, when staring into the abyss, that is a damn hard thing to admit. But he did. Proud. Self-made. Stubbornly independent to a fault. A lover of puzzles, excelling in War Game theory while serving in the Army. People were his passion, the ultimate puzzles. We would walk, talk. That was 2005. I described the tragic long-term consequences of Alan Greenspan’s morally hazardous Put. A core weakness in our system; namely that politicians are rewarded for profligate deficit spending, punished for prudence. And the ultimate cost; the loss of our economic dominance, compromised global leadership, downward spiral in the Dollar, rising interest rates, deep recession, depression perhaps. The wise old man considered it all, “This will be China’s century, I’m sure of that. What you describe, perhaps it will happen. Yes, it’s even likely. But not in my lifetime. No, these things take time, not in my lifetime, but in yours.” He knew little of economics except for the basics; if you owe someone money, they own you. So he took on debt as a young man – needed to – but lived frugally, paid it all back. Left his family asset rich. And I will always hold on to our walks, talks. Mara and I went to see him last week. His brilliant mind lost, dignity stolen, frail, skeletal. Alzheimer’s. Life holds far greater horrors than death. I quietly prayed for mercy – for both of them. And driving home, Mara gazed out the window, in tears, “I think that’s the last time I’ll ever see my Dad.”

        “The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’ becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine,” wrote Nobel economist Paul Krugman in 1998. “Bitcoin isn’t a new innovation; it’s been around since 2009, and in all that time nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it. It’s not a convenient medium of exchange; it’s not a stable store of value; it’s definitely not a unit of account,” tweeted Krugman this week to his 4.6mm Twitter followers.

        <b>Overall:</b> “Technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels needs to be replaced without delay. There is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the 21st century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities,” tweeted Pope Francis, condemning Bitcoin and its heretical offspring, sparking another burst of panic selling. Now, the Church has not exactly draped itself in glory when it comes to embracing the world’s most important scientific advances. Just ask Galileo who died in jail, then waited 300yrs for an apology from the Vatican. But it wasn’t just the Pope. You see, Elon’s tweet that criticized bitcoin mining’s use of fossil fuel spurred every ageing Luddite who has been consistently wrong about bitcoin’s ascent to pen yet another scathing op-ed. That’s natural, of course. Critics are always loudest in the hole. But this time they were crowded together with Fed officials, the IRS, US Treasury and the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing seemed to announce a new law to outlaw bitcoin mining every time the price staged an intra-day bounce. In human history, no single asset has come under such coordinated assault by the very global institutions that perpetually inflate asset prices in the name of securing prosperity. And yet, through it all, digital asset trading carried on, obliterating the leveraged longs, wiping out the weak. For the first time in decades, we saw the ferocious beauty of truly free markets operating at scale. Efficiently. Ruthlessly. These assets inhabit a world without a buyer of last resort to bail out its bankers. It was a remarkable display of antifragility. To appreciate it fully, simply imagine how today’s equity, bond and credit markets would withstand a withdrawal of government support, let alone a full-frontal assault. It is this independence and resiliency that underpins the longer-term attractiveness of digital assets. But like all powerful new technologies, their promise is poorly understood by most pundits. And amongst the many benefits that such technologies will produce, one of the more ironic is that despite today’s outcry, they have already begun to spur and finance an accelerating global transition to renewable energy.

       <b>Digital Market Comments (internal) – 5/19/21</b> (One River Digital – Marcel Kasumovich, Head of Research)
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        1/ This is a broader crypto trading washout. It is worth benchmarking the Bitcoin downturn to previous ones. We are approaching the percentage drawdown of the Feb-Mar 2020 period. A price decline to $23,700 or so would replicate the initial 2017-2018 downturn. The patterns thereafter of those two downturns were vastly different obviously. After the initial bottom in 2018, Bitcoin fell another 55% and it took nearly four years to recover the 2017 high-water. It took only months to recover the 2020 downturn. 
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        2/ The role of Grayscale lockups remains poorly understood. This was arbitrage demand for Bitcoin that now needs to be absorbed. In the next ten days, 33mm shares become unlocked and will need to be sold as the unwind of the original trade. Through the end of August, 151mm shares will be unlocked (22% of total supply). At a Bitcoin price of $33k, that is $3.2bln of supply to be absorbed. There can be high profile stresses in the ecosystem of players engaged in this trade. The Grayscale discount is fairly stable around 20% discount through the latest downturn, suggesting some institutional demand willing to absorb supply at prevailing prices.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        3/ We learn a lot from the ecosystem data. Take stablecoin prices. USD.T and USD.C are incredibly steady through this downturn. Dai shows a bit more volatility, trading to as low as 0.995 (to put into real world numbers, on $1mn of collateral we’re talking about a $5k haircut from Dai at the low in prices, which was quite brief). It is not nothing, particularly in violent markets. But overall, this element of the ecosystem is performing very well. Trading volumes in USD.T are running $64bln in the past 24 hours, roughly 3-times the start of the year.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        4/ The liquidity shock in leveraged trading markets is easily evident. Deribit is a good example. The bid-offer pricing on $10mn Bitcoin in the perpetual swap market (leveraged forwards) was wider than 30% earlier today and is currently around 10%. Other exchanges were trading at a fraction of this price tiering. You see the same in implied yields across exchanges. The 1-month annualized yield on the Deribit exchange plunged to -75% annualized at its worst point today. Ether is similar, though not as extreme as Bitcoin relative to last March.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        5/ There has been a rapid inflow of Bitcoin back to exchanges. This is an indicator of holders preparing to sell. In turn, cash holdings through markets like USD.T also show a rise. Large wallets or “whales” are not responsible for flows in the past month. Flipside Crypto does a terrific job of documenting these flows day by day. Smaller wallets and exchanges overwhelm the flow, accounting for 550k of Bitcoin token flows compared to 17k for whales. Ether flows are an entirely different architecture, even though the outcomes are correlated. The moves are between decentralized exchanges and smart contracts, such as ETH embedded in Dai.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        6/ Where do we go from here? The speed of moves and ecosystem make it clear this is a speculative risk move, with a liquidity component. Is the macro backdrop intact? Yes. Are there near-term challenges to overcome? Absolutely. Grayscale locks and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) guidance on decentralized finance are big ones. Not a crypto winter, more of a cold front from Washington. A recovery slower than March 2020, but much faster than 2018 would be my benchmark.
      </p>
      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Anecdote:</b> The Fed cut rates to what had once seemed an impossibility. It then left them there. Skepticism that rates would remain perpetually low eventually gave way to acceptance, which was soon followed by financial engineering. Back then, in 1993, with overnight rates held at 3.00%, yield-enhanced structured products offered 4.00% yields, 5.00%, sometimes higher, but only if overnight rates remained unchanged. To generate those higher yields, the structured notes sold options. If overnight rates either fell or rose, those options would lose a lot of money. But investors didn’t care, they couldn’t buy enough. And this depressed implied volatility and forced the products to take on ever greater leverage to maintain the benchmark-beating yields. When the Fed hiked rates in 1994, the bond market crashed. Salesmen who sold structured products cried. Literally. What a terrible way to lose money. It seemed like the kind of market to get short, at least until the mess got cleaned up. I chose to bet short term UK interest rates would head higher. It was a big position for me. But then one morning, UK rates inexplicably collapsed. A Tory MP had been found dead, hanging from his kitchen chandelier, with a drug-infused tangerine stuffed in his mouth, dressed only in women’s stockings (not terribly unusual for British MPs). The police quickly concluded poor Milligan died of autoerotic asphyxiation. Whoever first got information on the Milligan news correctly concluded it would embarrass John Major’s government. To divert attention, his Treasury would cut interest rates. This is how a politicized system works without an independent central bank (the Bank of England only gained independence in 1997). It was my biggest one-day career loss. And helped me learn that absolutely anything can happen. There is no such thing as fair or unfair. Markets simply are. You take them as they come.

        “So will they change all the maps now Dad?” asked Charlie. “Too soon to say at this stage, wars are notoriously unpredictable, and this one just started,” I explained. “Okay, but if Russia conquers Ukraine, will they just change the maps,” he asked, not yet freed from the illusion of certainty, stability. “Borders are always changing Charlie, especially in Europe. It’s the bloodiest place on earth. They’ve been killing each other forever. I’ll show you an amazing video that illustrates the shifting borders since 400 BC.” To see it click [here]. “Like the Crusades? We learned about those,” said my youngest. “Yeah, they’re part of the insanity.”

       <b>Overall:</b> “I am here. We are not putting down arms,” said Zelensky, standing in Kyiv, live streaming to his countrymen. “We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this,” continued Ukraine’s brave young President. “That is it. That's all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.” Western intelligence agencies identify Zelensky as Putin’s #1 target for assassination. His family #2. “The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride,” declared Zelensky, rejecting Biden’s offer to be evacuated. 43mm Ukrainians watched. 143mm Russians. 330mm Americans. 447mm Europeans. 1.45bln Chinese. Truth be told, most of our little planet’s 8bln watched as Zelensky played a remarkably weak hand with courage. David to Putin’s Goliath. In a world numbed by the cowardice of our politicians, such a display by the young Ukrainian reminded us of what we seem to have lost. What it means to lead. The power of one. Such individuals hold the potential to reshape history in unexpected ways. And as the Ukrainians rose to expel Russian invaders, western politicians were led by Zelensky, drawn to ratchet up their shamefully weak initial sanctions. Putin, of course, must now win at all costs and is therefore at his most dangerous. We will soon discover if he is insane, or simply ruthless. “If Western leaders do not provide assistance, then tomorrow war will knock on your doors,” warned Zelensky, appalled by the West’s timidity in imposing meaningful consequences. Construction for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline started a year after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. The unwillingness of the West’s politicians to call for shared near-term sacrifice to ensure long-term security and prosperity has created monsters. In Europe. Asia. Our climate. The financial system too. And we have entered a decade when, like it or not, we will be pressed to confront these problems of our own creation.

        <b>Red Buttons:</b> Russia has 6,255 nuclear weapons, followed by the US with 5,500. China has 350, France 290, the UK 225. Pakistan has 165 warheads to defend itself from India, with 156. Israel is estimated to have 90 nukes. North Korea is believed to have enough fuel to build 40-50 nukes. Iran is headed there too. We detonated Little Boy over Hiroshima in 1945 and killed 150,000. It had the force of 15,000 tons of TNT. The average nuke today contains the force of 100,000 tons. Many are far larger. One such weapon dropped on New York City would kill an untold number.

       <b>Fat Fingers:</b> Vladimir Putin controls Russia’s arsenal. Biden is America’s commander-in-chief. Xi Jinping rules over China, potentially for life. There’s Macron of course. Boris Johnson too. Imran Khan is Pakistan’s Prime Minister, although Arif Alvi is its President and commander-in-chief. Modi is India’s Prime Minister and regularly engages in petty skirmishes with two nuclear-armed neighbors. Naftali Bennett is Israel’s PM. Kim Jong-un leads North Korea with ten stubby fingers. And who could forget Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran for life.

        <b>Lonely:</b> One thing uniting humanity is the belief that the majority of earth’s 14,000 nuclear weapons are controlled by men who are mentally unstable and unfit to wield such awesome power. Some of us believe 100% of these weapons are controlled by such people. Barely a person on the planet would choose a nuclear war, yet we created a system that empowers others to do just that, on a moment’s notice. An alien would likely observe that such a concentration of power is a gross failure of any species. Perhaps it’s a stage of development that few, if any, advance beyond. Maybe that’s why we have not been visited.

        <b>Inevitable:</b> Absolute power corrupts absolutely. But not all power is absolute. So we observe gradations of corruption, usually corresponding to the degree to which power is concentrated. The Catholic Church is reluctantly confronting its decades of unforgivable sin, buried beneath bureaucracy. Whole industries have done the same. Big tobacco. The Sackler’s Purdue Pharma opioid epidemic. And corruption is contagious. So those nations that fight against it and honor the rule of law outperform others. But even in such societies, the battle is never won. We have come to accept that there is no better system. But nothing in human affairs is inevitable.

      <p class="weekend-content__article-paraghraph">
        <b>Impermanence:</b> Money is central to all modern human activity, yet it is an illusion. Central banks operate with governments to distort its value at will. The concentration of their power is as breathtaking as it is difficult for the citizenry to comprehend. While it is generally wielded with the best intentions, the impact on us all are profound. Since Lehman failed, global central banks have purchased $23.3trln of financial assets, lifting to new highs the fortunes of those who already had wealth, so that US private sector financial assets are now 6.3x GDP (up from 2.8x in the early 1980s). Such a societal choice was never put to a vote. And this system, like all systems we have created, is surely impermanent.

        <b>Anecdote:</b> “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking — it cannot be changed without changing our thinking,” wrote Einstein. Like much of his work, it contains many layers. And as with all things profound, the observation is timeless. Einstein helps us understand how we can have such deeply divided nations. They are in fact different realities, created by their respective inhabitants, as vivid to one group as the other. Only by opening our minds and changing our thinking can we connect the two. But Einstein also challenges us to examine our collective beliefs. One assumed truism is that the world must operate with centralized power structures. Tribes, kingdoms, empires, nation-states; we experimented with them all. And armies, religions, universities, corporations, financial exchanges, central banks. Atop each sits a King or Queen, President or Pope, choose your title, the function holds. Naturally, we have various methods of selecting leaders, and ways to empower or restrain them. We’ve also explored a variety of structures to distribute economic output. Feudalism, capitalism, socialism, communism. Some believe passionately in one or the other, but we all accept the broad structure because we assume the world cannot operate at scale without a central authority, a clearinghouse to mediate our disputes, set our standards, define domestic laws, international too. And enforce them. It is hard to imagine a world without centralized authority. But for the first time in human history, a new technology allows us to build decentralized accounting systems we can all trust. This is a stunning breakthrough upon which entirely new governance systems can be built. Bitcoin was the pioneer. Its success has spawned countless new applications, some more decentralized than others. The innovation has barely just begun and now attracts the brightest young minds across the world, allowing them to think about new, more inclusive ways to organize. Venture capital has followed. Speculators. The frenzy itself is breathtaking. And when we look back, 100-years hence, we will surely see this as the period when we began a great transition, even if today, we cannot yet quite imagine the world we will have created.
