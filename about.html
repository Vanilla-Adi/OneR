                Eric Peters is the Founder, CEO, and CIO of One River Asset Management and its subsidiary, One River
                Digital Asset Management. One River is an innovative investment manager dedicated to delivering
                high-conviction discretionary and quantitative strategies that help its clients build superior
                portfolios. One River sees the world in a period of major economic and political transition, with the
                investment landscape shifting in ways that will make the coming ten years look profoundly different from
                the past decade. Its strategies are built to profit from this dynamic environment while providing strong
                diversification benefits to traditional investment portfolios.
                <br>
                <br>
                Prior to founding One River in 2013, Eric served as Chairman of Grant Capital Partners, a $1.25 billion
                discretionary global macro hedge fund. In that role, Eric focused on thematic investment opportunities
                and was responsible for all non-investment activities including the direct oversight of the Chief Risk
                Officer. Over the course of his career, Eric has held various positions that include portfolio manager
                for Peloton Partners, proprietary trader for both Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse, and Founder and
                Chief Executive Officer of a TH Lee Putnam funded technology firm.
                <br>
                <br>
                Eric travels extensively, exchanging ideas, debating policy, and identifying investment opportunities
                with many of the world’s top investment managers, economists, strategists, political consultants,
                academics, scientists, and business leaders. The content of those discussions often finds its way into
                his weekly investment letter - Weekend Notes - which is read by investment professionals who directly
                deploy over $1trln in alternative assets.
